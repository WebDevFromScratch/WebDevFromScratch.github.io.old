I have been slacking a bit for the last couple of days. Watching World Cup apparently is not good for my free time! I wasn't feeling too good physically-wise and it wasn't helping either. As with everything in life though, a coin have two sides. For this past month I tried to do everything I could to learn and be that several steps closer to hopefully getting my first web developer job and finally I had a while to gain different perspective.

I've been thinking lot and figured out that I shouldn't really be speeding through [Tealeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com) courses as fast as possible. I should rather focus on making more effort to really grasp the material I'm learning and allow it to really sink in. And the best way to do it is again, through practice. I could probably just make some exercises on my own, but I figured I may as well check what the internet has to offer first. Needless to say, I was hoping there were some free (or really cheap) options available. That's how I found out (or rather re-discovered, because I heard about it before) [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).



## The Odin Project



So what is it? Well, in essence [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) (or TOP) is not that much different to [Tealeaf Academy](http://www.gotealeaf.com). They provide you with a curriculum, which includes a broad range of subjects, form learning the basics about web development, through Ruby and Rails, HTML and CSS and Javascript and it's jQuery library. There is also one more section related to getting your first job as a web developer. Sounds awesome, right? Yeah, I think so too. Especially because TOP is open-source, with constantly evolving curricullum and a nice, helpful community (at least from what I've heard). Just yesterday I decided that I should see what are they about.

I didn't have a chance to look closer at it since, but I will have the next few days for doing so. I have to pay a visit to my family and since I won't have my personal machine while I'm there (it's a desktop computer), I figured I'll spend the time trying out what TOP has to offer. I should give my first impression about it around the next weekend I guess. I'm really excited for it!



## Make it With Code



During my internet research for alternative learning sources, I also came across [Make it With Code](https://www.makeitwithcode.com/). Their credo is something I especially came to like: "Learn to Code by Making Things", which sounds like exactly what I was looking for. The idea is, you get a lesson a week, for 10 weeks (lessons are text-format, combining a balance of challenges with instruction). With each lesson you build one working thing. Sounds good to me!

There is one caveat: it's not free. The course costs $99, which isn't all that much considering what I'm paying for [Tealeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com) courses. I will likely be trying it out in the future. I couldn't find too many reviews on [Make it With Code](https://www.makeitwithcode.com/), so if you decide to try it before I do, please let me know if it's worth it.



## And Just a Quick Tealeaf Progress Check



I am currently about to wrap up the 2nd week of the Rails course. It's not going too smoothy so far. I understand most of the concepts (mostly thanks too the understanding of Ruby, which I gained through the 1st course) but I don't really feel too comfortable in Rails just yet. I think after finishing this course I will try to go through the materials once more and see how much of it I was able to truly absorb.

I have to say though, that I really like what we're building. It's a [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/)-alike app which has quite a few cool features about it. And we're learning some front-end along, with the use of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) too. I could really see how useful this all could be in the future. I guess I should write a longer post (with code examples) of what I've learned sometime soon.

Meanwhile, I also noticed some traffic here, on [Web Developer from Scratch](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com), which is likely caused by a cool domain name I was able to pick for it (score!) and google already indexing my little blog. Thus I encourage everyone who visits to leave comments if you have questions or words of encouragement (this really helps!). Or if you are in a similar situation to mine and want to become a web developer starting from nothing. Get in touch!
