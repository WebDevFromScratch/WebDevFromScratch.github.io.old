I did not come up with that title (maybe you figured by the quotes). I found a great blog post that explains what is the "secret", it's a pretty good read in itself and it addresses the case so well: [Stevey's Blog Rants](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html).

I was actually already looking for ways to learn touchtyping. I tried it once before a few months ago but I lacked persistence then. After reading Steve's post I don't anymore. I'm not writing all that slow to be honest, but my technique is far from perfect. And I know this is something I simply need if I want to have a headstart in any type of programming career. So I practiced for the last four days, 30 minutes each day. And I'm going to carry on for at least the next month and see where it takes me!


## Typingweb


Looking for a tool that would help me here, I came across [typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/). It's a great place where you can start learning touchtyping straight away, without the needÂ  of even downloading anything. There are free courses for beginners and advanced. Seems pretty cool to me! I'll post an update afer some time to see how my writing speed developed.
