Yeah, I was finally able to wrap the second [Tealeaf Academy](http://www.gotealeaf.com) course up! It was a lot of work for me, not everything is yet superclear. But I definitely learned a lot and now it's all a matter of practice, so the freshly aquired knowledge could sunk in for good. That's why I decided that before I start the third (and final) course, I should build some stuff on my own, as I mentioned in [my last post](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/crawling-forward-with-rails/). Let me sum up the course, as I did the [first one](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-2-course-1-done/).



## About the Course



The course is intended as a thorought introduction to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework and it definitely fulfills that and more. Again, I can tell you from a perspective of a guy who has zero previous experience with Rails, that you can absolutely go from a mindblow to a somewhat competent level in a month with this Tealeaf course. The learning is tied with building your first app and with each week you dive deeper into the framework. As a precourse exercise, you learn how easy it is to just go with Rails generators and built stuff this way. Then along the course you learn why this is actually not the best way to go about it and how to do it properly.

The second course is definitely way harder than the first one, it requires more work from you and more time as well. I often found myself not understanding the concepts and having to re-watch the video lectures a few times before I finally grasped it (but hey, maybe that's just me). I estimate I put almost twice as much time into learning compared to the first course. In the end though, I feel great about how much I was able to take from it and I definitely feel a little dangerous when it comes to Rails now. And again, I had tons of fun learning!



## What I Learned







  * Request/Response in Rails


  * MVC in Rails


  * Migrations


  * Associations (1:M, M:M, polymorphic)


  * RESTful (resourceful) routing


  * Model-backed and non-model-backed forms


  * Helpers


  * Partials


  * AJAX in Rails


  * Authentication from scratch


  * Intro to APIs



And much more in the process! I can't emphasize enough how hard it was (and to a point, still is) but also truly fulfilling. I realize how much I still don't know and I can't wait to learn as much as I can in the near future.



## What's Next?



As I said, I will be taking a few days break now to build some stuff. I plan on starting with a simple 'ToDo' list app. And then I will try to create a blogging up and move my blog there. This will definitely be much harder and I'm not sure I will be able to accomplish this, but I'm going to try either way. I'll maybe also work on some other apps on the way, depending on how much time will those two take.

Then I will start the third course, which is supposed to take 8-10 weeks. It's promised to be twice as hard as this one, so I'll definitely have my struggles with it. When I'm around mid-way through with it, I'll likely start scoping the market for opportunities for my first job as a junior developer.

I also plan on writing a series of posts detailing what I learned through the second [Tealeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com) course, with code examples and explanations. Hopefully this will help some people who are this one step behind me on their way to Rails developer (and definitely will help remembering what I learned).

So lots of stuff to do. Let's better get to work! Over and out!
