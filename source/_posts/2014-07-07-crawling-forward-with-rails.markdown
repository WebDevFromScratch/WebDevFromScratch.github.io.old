This will likely be a random rant about what I've been doing for the last week or so. I feel really tired and don't have a real plan for a post right now but I do feel it's been quiet here for too long and I need to try and keep at least some consistency if this blog is to prevail.



## Never Stop TeaLeaf-ing



No surprises here, I carry on with the [Tealeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com) curriculum. I've been taking a little more time on each subject lately, but I really feel like the knowledge sticks with me more often and it all start to tie together for real. I have one last week left on the second course and am now 100% sure I'm going to keep learning with the final one.

Even though I kind of feel I could have learned all I've learned so far on my own, I'm also quite convinced it would take me (at least) twice as much time. And time is of the highest value to me. I do love how the curriculum is structured and how we dive deeper at some places, really getting to know how Rails ties many technologies together. I also love how we learn how to make things from scratch and really understand what we're doing, instead of relying on various gems from the start. I do have some 'buts' as well, though I'm going to leave them until I write a sum up post of the second course.



## Odin is Calling



In regards to [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/), I didn't really do anything here since the last time, so not much to write about. I do have big plans for it though, as I really see the potential to take a lot from it. Hopefully, next update on TOP will provide more content.



## Time to Build



Since I finally feel I am able to build simple apps from start to finish, I think this is a good time to start creating some stuff. This will hopefully help me to get my first job some time from now. And I do already have a few ideas up my sleeve that I can start working on and hopefully be able to accomplish:

* A simple TO-DO app (never really found one that suits me well)
* Personal Finance Tracker (as above)
* Two apps that I've found as an initial challenge for an internship/junior dev job (those should be a good practice of what I've learned so far)
* Building a blog from scratch using Rails ([I've always wanted to do this!](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/1st-project-lets-go/))


I plan on spending 1-2 hrs a day building those. Hopefully this will make most of what I've learned so far really stick and become natural.



## Meetup Time



Tommorow I'm going to my first live Ruby meetup (with [KRUG](http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/)) and am pretty excited about it. I'm not really sure what to expect from it but I do hope to meet some more experienced developers and see where that might take me. Also, there's supposed to be free beer, so who wouldn't go? ;) I'll report on how the meetup went soon.
