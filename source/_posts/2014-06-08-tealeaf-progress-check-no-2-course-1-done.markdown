Okay, so I'm through with the Ruby course and I feel I should do a little sum up of that one. I actually finished about a week ago and am now well into the Rails (second) course, but let's not get ahead of myself



## A Bit About the Course



So before I started the [Tealeaf Academy](http://www.gotealeaf.com) I had basically zero Ruby knowledge. Haven't written a single line of code in Ruby. I was cruising through the course a little faster than the program suggests (it took me about 3 weeks altogether, including pre-course) but that was due to the fact that I had a lot of free time and was putting every second of that into learning Ruby. So do I feel I mastered the language after the course? Well, no, not really. But I do feel I can understand the code I read (for the most part). This is something that Tealeaf really excel in. Chris is doing a great job in explaining how everything works together. But I kind of wished that there was a little bit more of practice exercises. Yes, it is a valid point that practice is something I can do on my own, but still. I would love it there was more simple things that we had built throughout the course that would really helps the gained knowledge stick for good. One more thing I didn't like too much was that even though we built three programs/apps during the course, each of them was a Blackjack game. Sure, they were not the same, since we were using different concepts and tools on the way, but again, a little more variance here would be great. These things are something Tealeaf guys should probably do better in the future. Overall though, I have to say I was not disappointed by the course at all. I learned a lot. I learned in a nice, structured way. I learned fast. And it was fun!



## What I learned



So let's move on to what I was able to learn. Starting with Ruby:



	
  * how to install Ruby and it's gems and how they work

	
  * Ruby syntax and style

	
  * Ruby basics: variables (and their scope, methods, iterations, basic objects (arrays & hashes), classes and more)

	
  * procedural and OOP in Ruby

	
  * how to tie all these concepts together to create a working program


Aside of Ruby, I also learned a lot of stuff on the side:

	
  * Git and Github

	
  * choosing and working with text/code editor

	
  * basics of command line

	
  * pseudo code

	
  * HTTP protocol

	
  * HTML and CSS

	
  * Javascript and jQuery

	
  * AJAX

	
  * Bootstrap front-end framework

	
  * Sinatra Ruby framework

	
  * Heroku deployment


And most importantly, I learned how to solve problems/bugs on my own. And if I am not able to do so, how to explain the problem I'm having to more experienced programmers, so that they would be able to help me.

Needless to say, it was a lot of stuff in a very short time. I still don't feel super comfortable using all of that stuff, but I can now use this knowledge and gain practice on my own. I definitely need to look for a few simple Ruby programs that I can try to write on my own. I also need to review the things I'm not 100% sure about and try to understand them fully when I have a while to spare. Oh, and I guess I should start posting some code on the blog as well!

Still, I'm not stopping here and am now going further with Rails. Loving it so far!
