I've been quiet for quite a while now. I got kind of lost in the process of learning so many various things related to web development, that I forgot about what I initially aimed for. And that is, building real things. Until recently, I tried so many different things and with each of these tools (languages, frameworks, whatever have you), I only barely scratched the surface. Luckily, I finally realized that it's not the best way to go about it all. I realized what I should've been doing from the start is trying to master one thing. And if I succeed, then try something else. So I tried to follow this approach and actually become good at something.


## Dig Deeper


I decided I should learn one language first. But not just "go through some online tutorial" learn. Learn it for real. Then go look for a job using that language and progress further. Still not knowing much about how to do it, I found a cool [Python course at a popular MOOCs site Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) (if you're not sure what MOOC is, check this [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)). I can't say anything bad about it at all, to be honest. I like the approach (building games), the lecturers (Steve is simply hilarious!), forums and all, yet there was one thing that wouldn't stop bothering me. I was learning and having fun with it, but I had no idea how to put all that knowledge to good use in my soon-to-happen (LOL!) web development career. I ditched the final two-week long project and started to look for something that would suit my needs better.


## Bootcamps


I got introduced to the idea of web development bootcamps. How do they work? In essence, you spend 3-4 months learning how to program in a given language, under the guidance of experience instructors (and learning many other related thins along the way). After that period, they (your former instructors) will likely introduce you to an employer. And bang - you just started your career as a developer. Sounds nice, right? Obviously, these camps do not come free, but it's an investments worth the price (which varies from around $5k to something like $20k). The thing is, those bootcamps seem to be very popular in the US, but not that much in other parts of the world (yet!)*.

Still, I was hooked to the idea. I started to evaluate my options for something similar online. There is actually quite some choice. After googling for a while, reading a bunch of reviews and doing comparisons on my own, I decided to settle on [Tealeaf](https://www.gotealeaf.com).


## Tealeaf Academy


What attracted me to it? For starters, I like the approach of dividing the whole learning material into three courses. If you are not a total beginner, you can start from the second or a third one. Plus, you don't have to pay for all of it at once. You pay for each module (course) separately, so I only needed to spend like $500 to get started with the first one.**

Secondly, I love how they don't try to lure you in only to get your money. When you do your research, you'll see that Tealeaf representatives often use phrases like "it's not for everyone", "it might not suit you", "for some people, other options might be better". They know that actually taking their courses involves a lot of self-discipline and motivation. You really need to be willing to do the job on your own if you are to accomplish their programme.

Thirdly, there are no set, hard deadlines. Tealeaf guys understand well that not everyone has the same amount of time in hand. Each course is divided into weeks, but you can spend as much time on each week as you want. You only have 10 hours a week to spend on the course? No problem. You want to go at it full-time and finish well ahead of everyone else? Sure, why not. I love this because I don't have the same amount of free time every week, it varies. So whenever I can, I learn and if I need to do something else, the course is not going anywhere.

Another thing. When you have a question, you ask it in a forums and one of the TAs will answer you often in a matter of minutes, so you can continue working on your code almost straight away. You don't need to wait for a specific day in the week, when you have your session with a mentor scheduled (that's how [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/), another popular "bootcampy" site does it). I guess this depends on what you prefer, for me the forums is clearly a better fit.

Finally, Tealeaf promises you moneyback option if you happen not to like how they go about stuff. That's a big sign of confidence in their own learning methods.

Oh, and I almost forgot. THE MOST IMPORTANT: after completing all three courses, you should be able to build your own app using Ruby on Rails. And make it fully working on the web. That's exactly what I needed!***


## So Where am I?


Well, not too far yet. I'm only after pre-course and week 1 of the first course and tackling the material of the second. I actually am finding out, that my previous Coursera Python course is a big help right now. It appears that when you once figure out how programmers think, the language doesn't matter that much (but granted, Python and Ruby are quite similar, in my opinion at least).

Starting a blog was actually one of the assignments/advice in the first week of the course. And I'm glad it was there, because I seriously don't know if I would be writing here in the future if not for that... There will likely be a lot of Ruby (and Rails as I progress) related stuff here from now on but I'll try to post some useful stuff regarding other things as well from time to time. I actually have quite a large base of useful links that I gathered over that few months of my learning, so hopefully you might find some useful stuff if you're not Ruby-focused, too.

*To my surprise, I actually found out there are some options in Poland as well. For example [Coders Lab](http://coderslab.pl/). Still, it’s more expensive than Tealeaf, seems to cover less material and I would likely need to move to Warsaw (there is a weekend course, but it lasts for 16 weekends – no way I could have so many in a row free of other arrangements).

**By the way, price for all three courses is quite advantegous too.

***No, I am not associated with Tealeaf in any other way than learning from them. I do love their stuff and I simply wrote what I think of them.
