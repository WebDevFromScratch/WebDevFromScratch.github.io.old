Wow, so much dust in here! As if nobody posted here for two months or so. Oh, wait...

That was a long break for me and I can't say that it was fully planned. I did plan about a month off learning (longer holidays with the fiancee was long due) but after that I lost focus and couldn't go back to [Tealeaf](http://www.gotealeaf.com). I also got back to my part-time side gig and that took a part of my time, too. But then one must make money somehow to finance the time sacrificed for learning new things.

Overall, I once again feel ready for hard work (and lots of it!). I feel like I need a written plan, though, so I don't lose focus again. And I guess it's best to share that plan on a public forum (that means here, on this very blog), which should cause me being more responsible in sticking to it. I'm going to post it as the next entry as soon as I figure this out, maybe I'll be updating the plan on the go, but I need at least a rough one ASAP.

Meanwhile, for about a week now I was reminding myself the basics of Ruby and Rails again. Boy, I got really rusty during my time off! Right now I'm in process of writing a simple blog app to repeat the basic concepts in practice, I'll post a link to it on [my github](https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch) once it's done.
