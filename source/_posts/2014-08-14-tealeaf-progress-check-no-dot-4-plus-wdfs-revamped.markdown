Long time no see. I just made a promise to myself [last time](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/building-is-fun/) that I will be writing at least one post each week and then go on a 20-day-no-post spell straigh away. Nicely played, man... It is a holiday season here and I did take a couple days breaks here and there, it's also not like I was doing nothing all the time, so let's get to what happened since last blog post.

## Having Fun with rspec and HAML

So I wrapped up the first week of the [3rd and last Tealeaf course](http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps), which took me a little bit longer than I thought. The curriculum focuses strongly on [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) in Rails and this first week was a very good introduction. I learned how to use [rspec](http://rspec.info/) and why it's good to have tests for my apps. It was also a whole new experience, writing a Rails app using tests. I have to say I like this way a lot! It's like first thinking about what each piece of code I'm about to write should accomplish, laying out guidlines for it and only afterwards writing this code, so that it fulfills the set requirements. So far, I am a bit confused with tests and I seem to miss some cases writing them on my own. But solution videos are always there to clear any doubts I have any, so I can fix my mistakes on the go. Also, the course forums started to feel more alive as of late (even though I was not a part of it, lol).

And then there's [HAML](http://haml.info/). I was really confused about what's going when I first saw mockups for pages wirtten in HAML. And I know that after these breaks I've been having I will probably go through the confusions all over again (it should be a tad easier this time, hopefully). But after learning the basic rules of it, I love HAML! The markup is so much better than pure HTML, there's a lot less to write and it simply looks prettier when I look at my code! The only thing is, one really needs to be careful about what he's doing. Simple indentation mistake could cause a lot of problems, that seem really hard to catch later on.

## A Whole New Web Developer from Scratch

This took me a good week, but finally I can say I am done. I decided I had it with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and it's time to move to something else, my new choice being [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on speed, which is [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). It is different than WP, in a way that there's not really a database to work with. It's really a collection of static sites, generated each time when you use a specific rake command in the console.

With the help of instructions that can be found on Octopress docs pages and some google search, I was able to create a brand new blog with it. Next thing to do was to customize the look ([Octostrap3](https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3) was exactly what I was looking for, needed only minor tweaking), import my stuff from Wordpress (easy!), deploy to Github pages (easier!) and delegating the comments to 3rd party system - [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) (should be easy, but I had my hard times with this). Just like that, I had my blog re-created from scratch. Neat!

Yet this was not enough. In the pre-course for the 3rd Tealeaf course, there was an exercise to do. Learn jQuery, it said, go to a great tutorial called "[Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/)" and have fun. And I did. The tutorial was awesome and even though I had done some jQuery before, I had a great time with it. It's amazing how much can one accomplish on the front-end, knowing only the basics of jQuery. Simple, yet classy effects are extremely easy to create with it's help. Needless to say, after the tutorial I wanted some more practice. Building my personal website seemed like a perfect exercise.

I am not going to write in details how it was done, but you can see the effects here on [Web Developer from Scratch](http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/). It was really cool and made me realize that as much as I love writing back-end logic, I like working on the front-end almost just as much. Thus next time, when I write another Rails practice app, I'll also work on it's looks as well afterwards. Should be tons of fun!

## What's Ahead

Well, I'm not making any promises this time. I have my next few weekend full, so again less time for learning, which is not great. As I said before though, it's not a sprint. I just need to work hard whenever I can (as well as write here!) and that's it. I really miss learning with Tealeaf, so the motivation is there. I need to clean the code for my personal website, too. So far, I focused mostly on making it work and not too much on DRY and cleanliness.

I've also started to 'test the job market waters' by sending a couple of resumes out. I'm not 100% sure I'm ready, but on the other hand I know that I could learn even faster if I got a job at this point. I guess we'll see what comes of it.

Until next!
