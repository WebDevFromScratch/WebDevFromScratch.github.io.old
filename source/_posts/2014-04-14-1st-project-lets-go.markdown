Okay, so it's high time to start really doing something real! I am already engaged in a few non-commercial projects, but here's my highest priority for some time to come: make Web Developer from Scratch my personal, custom website.

While I have nothing against the WordPress theme I started here on (I actually think it's looking really nice(Hexa theme, I'll make some screenshot before I change looks to keep the good memories)), I did already see a couple blogs running on the very same one. Well, I want mine to be personalized. Plus, I want to do a little showing-off my web development skills ;)


## Details


Okay, so what I plan on doing here:



	
  * Build a cool home page (already started on this)

	
  * Buy a .com domain and setting it all up again there

	
  * Make other pages I'll likely need (blog page + posts, about and contact pages and another one where I could show my work)


Just a 3 point, very simple plan. I'm really excited as this will be the very first website I'd do totally from scratch up to working stage. Needless to say I probably don't know everything I need for doing so but I'll be learning in the process. And after I'm done I'll have something to show my potential future employer right there, so motivation is high. I actually hope to be able to find my first job in the industry in a few months, so definitely need a portfolio.

Not rambling any longer, let's get to work!
