<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have been slacking a bit for the last couple of days. Watching World Cup apparently is not good for my free time! I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too good physically-wise and it wasn&rsquo;t helping either. As with everything in life though, a coin have two sides. For this past month I tried to do everything I could to learn and be that several steps closer to hopefully getting my first web developer job and finally I had a while to gain different perspective.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking lot and figured out that I shouldn&rsquo;t really be speeding through <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses as fast as possible. I should rather focus on making more effort to really grasp the material I&rsquo;m learning and allow it to really sink in. And the best way to do it is again, through practice. I could probably just make some exercises on my own, but I figured I may as well check what the internet has to offer first. Needless to say, I was hoping there were some free (or really cheap) options available. That&rsquo;s how I found out (or rather re-discovered, because I heard about it before) <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

<h2>The Odin Project</h2>

<p>So what is it? Well, in essence <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (or TOP) is not that much different to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a>. They provide you with a curriculum, which includes a broad range of subjects, form learning the basics about web development, through Ruby and Rails, HTML and CSS and Javascript and it&rsquo;s jQuery library. There is also one more section related to getting your first job as a web developer. Sounds awesome, right? Yeah, I think so too. Especially because TOP is open-source, with constantly evolving curricullum and a nice, helpful community (at least from what I&rsquo;ve heard). Just yesterday I decided that I should see what are they about.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to look closer at it since, but I will have the next few days for doing so. I have to pay a visit to my family and since I won&rsquo;t have my personal machine while I&rsquo;m there (it&rsquo;s a desktop computer), I figured I&rsquo;ll spend the time trying out what TOP has to offer. I should give my first impression about it around the next weekend I guess. I&rsquo;m really excited for it!</p>

<h2>Make it With Code</h2>

<p>During my internet research for alternative learning sources, I also came across <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>. Their credo is something I especially came to like: &ldquo;Learn to Code by Making Things&rdquo;, which sounds like exactly what I was looking for. The idea is, you get a lesson a week, for 10 weeks (lessons are text-format, combining a balance of challenges with instruction). With each lesson you build one working thing. Sounds good to me!</p>

<p>There is one caveat: it&rsquo;s not free. The course costs $99, which isn&rsquo;t all that much considering what I&rsquo;m paying for <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses. I will likely be trying it out in the future. I couldn&rsquo;t find too many reviews on <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>, so if you decide to try it before I do, please let me know if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<h2>And Just a Quick Tealeaf Progress Check</h2>

<p>I am currently about to wrap up the 2nd week of the Rails course. It&rsquo;s not going too smoothy so far. I understand most of the concepts (mostly thanks too the understanding of Ruby, which I gained through the 1st course) but I don&rsquo;t really feel too comfortable in Rails just yet. I think after finishing this course I will try to go through the materials once more and see how much of it I was able to truly absorb.</p>

<p>I have to say though, that I really like what we&rsquo;re building. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>-alike app which has quite a few cool features about it. And we&rsquo;re learning some front-end along, with the use of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> too. I could really see how useful this all could be in the future. I guess I should write a longer post (with code examples) of what I&rsquo;ve learned sometime soon.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, I also noticed some traffic here, on <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com">Web Developer from Scratch</a>, which is likely caused by a cool domain name I was able to pick for it (score!) and google already indexing my little blog. Thus I encourage everyone who visits to leave comments if you have questions or words of encouragement (this really helps!). Or if you are in a similar situation to mine and want to become a web developer starting from nothing. Get in touch!</p>
