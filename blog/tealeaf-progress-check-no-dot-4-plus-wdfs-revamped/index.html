<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Long time no see. I just made a promise to myself <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/building-is-fun/">last time</a> that I will be writing at least one post each week and then go on a 20-day-no-post spell straigh away. Nicely played, man&hellip; It is a holiday season here and I did take a couple days breaks here and there, it&rsquo;s also not like I was doing nothing all the time, so let&rsquo;s get to what happened since last blog post.</p>

<h2>Having Fun with rspec and HAML</h2>

<p>So I wrapped up the first week of the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps">3rd and last Tealeaf course</a>, which took me a little bit longer than I thought. The curriculum focuses strongly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD) in Rails and this first week was a very good introduction. I learned how to use <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> and why it&rsquo;s good to have tests for my apps. It was also a whole new experience, writing a Rails app using tests. I have to say I like this way a lot! It&rsquo;s like first thinking about what each piece of code I&rsquo;m about to write should accomplish, laying out guidlines for it and only afterwards writing this code, so that it fulfills the set requirements. So far, I am a bit confused with tests and I seem to miss some cases writing them on my own. But solution videos are always there to clear any doubts I have any, so I can fix my mistakes on the go. Also, the course forums started to feel more alive as of late (even though I was not a part of it, lol).</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a>. I was really confused about what&rsquo;s going when I first saw mockups for pages wirtten in HAML. And I know that after these breaks I&rsquo;ve been having I will probably go through the confusions all over again (it should be a tad easier this time, hopefully). But after learning the basic rules of it, I love HAML! The markup is so much better than pure HTML, there&rsquo;s a lot less to write and it simply looks prettier when I look at my code! The only thing is, one really needs to be careful about what he&rsquo;s doing. Simple indentation mistake could cause a lot of problems, that seem really hard to catch later on.</p>

<h2>A Whole New Web Developer from Scratch</h2>

<p>This took me a good week, but finally I can say I am done. I decided I had it with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and it&rsquo;s time to move to something else, my new choice being <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on speed, which is <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. It is different than WP, in a way that there&rsquo;s not really a database to work with. It&rsquo;s really a collection of static sites, generated each time when you use a specific rake command in the console.</p>

<p>With the help of instructions that can be found on Octopress docs pages and some google search, I was able to create a brand new blog with it. Next thing to do was to customize the look (<a href="https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3">Octostrap3</a> was exactly what I was looking for, needed only minor tweaking), import my stuff from Wordpress (easy!), deploy to Github pages (easier!) and delegating the comments to 3rd party system - <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> (should be easy, but I had my hard times with this). Just like that, I had my blog re-created from scratch. Neat!</p>

<p>Yet this was not enough. In the pre-course for the 3rd Tealeaf course, there was an exercise to do. Learn jQuery, it said, go to a great tutorial called &ldquo;<a href="http://try.jquery.com/">Try jQuery</a>&rdquo; and have fun. And I did. The tutorial was awesome and even though I had done some jQuery before, I had a great time with it. It&rsquo;s amazing how much can one accomplish on the front-end, knowing only the basics of jQuery. Simple, yet classy effects are extremely easy to create with it&rsquo;s help. Needless to say, after the tutorial I wanted some more practice. Building my personal website seemed like a perfect exercise.</p>

<p>I am not going to write in details how it was done, but you can see the effects here on <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/">Web Developer from Scratch</a>. It was really cool and made me realize that as much as I love writing back-end logic, I like working on the front-end almost just as much. Thus next time, when I write another Rails practice app, I&rsquo;ll also work on it&rsquo;s looks as well afterwards. Should be tons of fun!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not making any promises this time. I have my next few weekend full, so again less time for learning, which is not great. As I said before though, it&rsquo;s not a sprint. I just need to work hard whenever I can (as well as write here!) and that&rsquo;s it. I really miss learning with Tealeaf, so the motivation is there. I need to clean the code for my personal website, too. So far, I focused mostly on making it work and not too much on DRY and cleanliness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started to &lsquo;test the job market waters&rsquo; by sending a couple of resumes out. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure I&rsquo;m ready, but on the other hand I know that I could learn even faster if I got a job at this point. I guess we&rsquo;ll see what comes of it.</p>

<p>Until next!</p>
