<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m through with the Ruby course and I feel I should do a little sum up of that one. I actually finished about a week ago and am now well into the Rails (second) course, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of myself</p>

<h2>A Bit About the Course</h2>

<p>So before I started the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a> I had basically zero Ruby knowledge. Haven&rsquo;t written a single line of code in Ruby. I was cruising through the course a little faster than the program suggests (it took me about 3 weeks altogether, including pre-course) but that was due to the fact that I had a lot of free time and was putting every second of that into learning Ruby. So do I feel I mastered the language after the course? Well, no, not really. But I do feel I can understand the code I read (for the most part). This is something that Tealeaf really excel in. Chris is doing a great job in explaining how everything works together. But I kind of wished that there was a little bit more of practice exercises. Yes, it is a valid point that practice is something I can do on my own, but still. I would love it there was more simple things that we had built throughout the course that would really helps the gained knowledge stick for good. One more thing I didn&rsquo;t like too much was that even though we built three programs/apps during the course, each of them was a Blackjack game. Sure, they were not the same, since we were using different concepts and tools on the way, but again, a little more variance here would be great. These things are something Tealeaf guys should probably do better in the future. Overall though, I have to say I was not disappointed by the course at all. I learned a lot. I learned in a nice, structured way. I learned fast. And it was fun!</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<p>So let&rsquo;s move on to what I was able to learn. Starting with Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>how to install Ruby and it&rsquo;s gems and how they work</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby syntax and style</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby basics: variables (and their scope, methods, iterations, basic objects (arrays &amp; hashes), classes and more)</p></li>
<li><p>procedural and OOP in Ruby</p></li>
<li><p>how to tie all these concepts together to create a working program</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Aside of Ruby, I also learned a lot of stuff on the side:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git and Github</p></li>
<li><p>choosing and working with text/code editor</p></li>
<li><p>basics of command line</p></li>
<li><p>pseudo code</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP protocol</p></li>
<li><p>HTML and CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript and jQuery</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap front-end framework</p></li>
<li><p>Sinatra Ruby framework</p></li>
<li><p>Heroku deployment</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And most importantly, I learned how to solve problems/bugs on my own. And if I am not able to do so, how to explain the problem I&rsquo;m having to more experienced programmers, so that they would be able to help me.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it was a lot of stuff in a very short time. I still don&rsquo;t feel super comfortable using all of that stuff, but I can now use this knowledge and gain practice on my own. I definitely need to look for a few simple Ruby programs that I can try to write on my own. I also need to review the things I&rsquo;m not 100% sure about and try to understand them fully when I have a while to spare. Oh, and I guess I should start posting some code on the blog as well!</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m not stopping here and am now going further with Rails. Loving it so far!</p>
