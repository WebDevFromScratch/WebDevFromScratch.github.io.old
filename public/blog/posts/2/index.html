    </p>
    <p>I have been slacking a bit for the last couple of days. Watching World Cup apparently is not good for my free time! I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too good physically-wise and it wasn&rsquo;t helping either. As with everything in life though, a coin have two sides. For this past month I tried to do everything I could to learn and be that several steps closer to hopefully getting my first web developer job and finally I had a while to gain different perspective.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking lot and figured out that I shouldn&rsquo;t really be speeding through <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses as fast as possible. I should rather focus on making more effort to really grasp the material I&rsquo;m learning and allow it to really sink in. And the best way to do it is again, through practice. I could probably just make some exercises on my own, but I figured I may as well check what the internet has to offer first. Needless to say, I was hoping there were some free (or really cheap) options available. That&rsquo;s how I found out (or rather re-discovered, because I heard about it before) <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

<h2>The Odin Project</h2>

<p>So what is it? Well, in essence <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (or TOP) is not that much different to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a>. They provide you with a curriculum, which includes a broad range of subjects, form learning the basics about web development, through Ruby and Rails, HTML and CSS and Javascript and it&rsquo;s jQuery library. There is also one more section related to getting your first job as a web developer. Sounds awesome, right? Yeah, I think so too. Especially because TOP is open-source, with constantly evolving curricullum and a nice, helpful community (at least from what I&rsquo;ve heard). Just yesterday I decided that I should see what are they about.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to look closer at it since, but I will have the next few days for doing so. I have to pay a visit to my family and since I won&rsquo;t have my personal machine while I&rsquo;m there (it&rsquo;s a desktop computer), I figured I&rsquo;ll spend the time trying out what TOP has to offer. I should give my first impression about it around the next weekend I guess. I&rsquo;m really excited for it!</p>

<h2>Make it With Code</h2>

<p>During my internet research for alternative learning sources, I also came across <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>. Their credo is something I especially came to like: &ldquo;Learn to Code by Making Things&rdquo;, which sounds like exactly what I was looking for. The idea is, you get a lesson a week, for 10 weeks (lessons are text-format, combining a balance of challenges with instruction). With each lesson you build one working thing. Sounds good to me!</p>

<p>There is one caveat: it&rsquo;s not free. The course costs $99, which isn&rsquo;t all that much considering what I&rsquo;m paying for <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses. I will likely be trying it out in the future. I couldn&rsquo;t find too many reviews on <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>, so if you decide to try it before I do, please let me know if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<h2>And Just a Quick Tealeaf Progress Check</h2>

<p>I am currently about to wrap up the 2nd week of the Rails course. It&rsquo;s not going too smoothy so far. I understand most of the concepts (mostly thanks too the understanding of Ruby, which I gained through the 1st course) but I don&rsquo;t really feel too comfortable in Rails just yet. I think after finishing this course I will try to go through the materials once more and see how much of it I was able to truly absorb.</p>

<p>I have to say though, that I really like what we&rsquo;re building. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>-alike app which has quite a few cool features about it. And we&rsquo;re learning some front-end along, with the use of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> too. I could really see how useful this all could be in the future. I guess I should write a longer post (with code examples) of what I&rsquo;ve learned sometime soon.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, I also noticed some traffic here, on <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com">Web Developer from Scratch</a>, which is likely caused by a cool domain name I was able to pick for it (score!) and google already indexing my little blog. Thus I encourage everyone who visits to leave comments if you have questions or words of encouragement (this really helps!). Or if you are in a similar situation to mine and want to become a web developer starting from nothing. Get in touch!</p>

    </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m long due another update on how my progress with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> is going, but I just can&rsquo;t force myself to write it&hellip; Let me just say I dived deep into Rails and am trying to wrap my head around it&rsquo;s magic (actually, there&rsquo;s no magic at all, just conventions that Rails assumes - definitely need to write something about it soon!).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I figured I&rsquo;ll post notes on the latest video lecture I watched. If you stumbled upon this blog of mine and are thinking about joining Tealeaf, this is an example of what we learn there. Making these sort of notes is not mandatory of course, everything you need is in video format. But I like to make them, it helps me memorize more. Okay, no more rambling, move on the notes (these are from Lecture 3 of the Rails course).</p>

<h2>Rails Forms</h2>

<p>sidenote: in Rails we can refer to a key by a symbol (in params hash, for example) even though it&rsquo;s a string (a hash with indifferent access)</p>

<p>Creating a form
- how to do that using 3 ways (on an example of a new (creating) post form)</p>

<h3>1. Pure HTML</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>HTML form</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">&#39;/posts&#39;</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">&#39;POST&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  Title: <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&#39;text&#39;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#39;my_title&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;br/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&#39;submit&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t as a deault work in Rails, because of a &lsquo;protect_from_forgery&rsquo; validation error (if we removed protect_from_forgery from application_controller.rb, this would work)</p>

<p>this is not the best from the point of security of our app</p>

<p>This is the most manual way, we never do this in Rails. We&rsquo;d need to hack our application_controller and we definitely don&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<h3>2. Rails form helper</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Form Helper</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_tag &#39;/posts&#39; do %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">label_tag</span> <span class="ss">:title</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%= text_field_tag :title %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">submit_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Create Post&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this adds authenticity_token (which is hidden in html), which is needed for this &lsquo;protect_from_forgery&rsquo; validation to work
helpers give us these little things that speeds up the work and saves us from some weird edge case errors</p>

<p>label element is correlated with input element (refers to it); is used for screenreaders that recognizes what&rsquo;s what (useful for blind internet users for example, to help them) &lt;&mdash; try to develop a habit of setting label elements</p>

<p>This would work just as the above HTML form.</p>

<h3>3. Rails model-backed form</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Model-Backed Form</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_for @post do |f| %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">label</span> <span class="ss">:title</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Create Post&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>we need to set our @something variable in the controller (PostsController in case of @post) for it to work of course</p>

<p>  it assumes a lot of things for us</p>

<p>  creates an additional nested structure in our session params (adding another nested hash for &lsquo;post&rsquo; key, where it assigns stuff specific to post, like title, etc.)</p>

<p>  naming conventions for how Rails saves these variables to create that nested structure can be seen when inspecting the HTML code (in browser), it has this format: post[title]</p>

<p>  !(that&rsquo;s why in code (especially Rails 3.x) we can see a lot of code that looks like this: Post.new(params[:post]))</p>

<p>  !also, thus we can do a mass assignment to Post object like this: Post.new(&lsquo;title&rsquo;=>&lsquo;some title&rsquo;) or Post.new(title: &lsquo;some title&rsquo;, url: &lsquo;some url&rsquo;) &lt;&mdash; these keys are our setter methods that come from ActiveRecord::Base; essentially that&rsquo;s because we have the columns called that in our database &lsquo;posts&rsquo; table</p>

<p>  we can also use virtual attributes as keys here (like user:, category:, etc. &lt;&mdash; we set associations to these earlier)</p>

<p>  we can&rsquo;t just add random fields here though (like f.text_field :whatever) do to the connection we have with other layers (that Rails assumes) - we can only use variables that we can use mass assignments with (our table columns) as keys</p>

<p>  otherwise the connection (assumption, convention) breaks and we&rsquo;d get a &lsquo;NoMethod&rsquo; error
  we can add whatever variable we please in case of &lsquo;Rails form helpers&rsquo;, because then we just save them in our session params and not using these model-backed relations</p>

<p>Use whenever we can!</p>

<p>To use this model-backed form, we need to appropriately set our &lsquo;create&rsquo; action in posts_controller.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:post</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#this way we access params specific for our post</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Strong parameters can be a cause of a lot of silent bugs (because they are security-related, there are usually no specific error messages)</p>

<p>!note: we don&rsquo;t want to use .create, because first we need to fulfill validation requirements - strong parameters (check below, then continue here) - so we need to change this like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_params</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:notice</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Your post was created!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="n">posts_path</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">&#39;new&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>!!!!! This above is very important pattern that needs to be memorized !!!!!</p>

<p>  if we create (.save method) our post, we want to redirect</p>

<p>  else (in case we hit a validation error, etc.), we want to render our template where we tried to create from again (which would now show our errors, letting the user know what needs to be done to create)</p>

<h3>Strong Parameters</h3>

<p>back in Rails 3.x this was solved through &lsquo;attr_accessible&rsquo;, which we set in our models
example:</p>

<p>  attr_accessible :title, :url, :description</p>

<p>this above essentially whitelisted the mentioned variables for mass assignment</p>

<p>  Cons of this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>people overdid that and whitelisted everything, whenever hit an error (thus, losing security)</p></li>
<li><p>this needed to be set in the &lsquo;Model&rsquo; layer, and the concern is actually in the actions (&lsquo;Controller&rsquo;)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Rails 4 solves this by using strong parameters instead of attr_accessible</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we can set this in the Controller</p></li>
<li><p>we can set this based on an user</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We set it as a private method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>this require(:post) relates to our nested structured hash (we need a :post top-level key in our params, and then we set which lower-level (post) keys we want to permit to mass assignment)</p></li>
<li><p>.permit! - permits everything
thus we can use it like this:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Strong parameters can be a cause of a lot of silent bugs (because they are security-related, there are usually no specific error messages)</p>

<h3>Validations</h3>

<p>Always added to the &lsquo;Model&rsquo; layer</p>

<p>We use them like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>post.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#code code code</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">presence</span> <span class="ss">:true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this above means we need to have a title when creating a Post object</p>

<p>if we try to create the Post without the title, we get a rollback (we get returned &lsquo;false&rsquo;; why? because we use if statement in our pattern in the Controller)</p>

<p>note: we can create our post &lsquo;in memory&rsquo;, the error will only appear when we try to hit a database with a query (try to save it)</p>

<p>to check what the error is, we can use .errors method (e.g. post.errors) in the console</p>

<p>when we hit that, we get a @messages hash with errors</p>

<p>then we can use a pre-set syntax post.error.full_messages, to return all the error communicates in an array (e.g. [&ldquo;Title can&rsquo;t be blank&rdquo;, &ldquo;Url can&rsquo;t be blank&rdquo;])</p>

<p>This above is a weird way to save validation errors, but this is Rails convention (to set these types of errors on an object itself)</p>

<p>Looking back at our model-backed form:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can see that if there&rsquo;s an error, we render the view with the form again. We do it, so the user (client) will be able to fix their mistakes (we also need to add specific error communicates to the view - need to display the errors):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>new.html.erb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">errors</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any?</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  There were some errors:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="vi">@post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">errors</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">full_messages</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>we can style these above appropriately ofc</p>

<p>this is another pro to using model-backed forms, because we get those nice errors</p>

<p>!Careful: if we hit an error, in our view (HTML in browser), our errors &lsquo;error fields&rsquo; automatically gets wrapped in an additional div (class=&ldquo;field_with_errors&rdquo;) - this is somethign Rails adds for us out of the box, then it&rsquo;s up to us to only give it a whatever style we want (CSS) (we can highlight the field, etc.)</p>

<h3>Re-using our previously created form for edit and update action</h3>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>looking at HTML, this issues a POST request to /posts/id, but we have no route for this - instead it goes to the &lsquo;update&rsquo; action</p>

<p>if we look closer inspecting HTML, there are a few hidden things wrapped in a div, one of them looking like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;_method&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;hidden&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;patch&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this is where our HTML verb (method) is actually re-assigned to PATCH (Rails uses session params for this, because some browsers only supports GET and POST methods &lt;&mdash; another Rails convention)</p>

<p>!!!!! - form_for is smart enough to recognize if our instance variable (@post in the example) refers to an existing object or creating a new one and will set the correct verb/method (in the hidden element) accordingly &mdash;- thus we can extract our form to a partial and use it for different actions (create, edit, etc.) !!!!!</p>

<p>Our form partial that we could create here would effectively be used by 4 actions (new, create, edit, update) - thus we need to be very careful here.</p>

<p>since our form uses @post instance variable, each action needs to have it defined
make sure to test all the paths that we use/redirect to (especially error cases)</p>

<h3>before_action (in Rails 3.x - before_filters)</h3>

<p>If we notice that in many of our actions we use some code many times, we can extract this to before_actions (which works like before filter in Sinatra):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&lsquo;:set_post&rsquo; sets our action to be executed before each action</p>

<p>&lsquo;only:&rsquo; filters this to certain actions we want</p>

<p>since we can set some repeating actions to that kind of before filter, we can end up having some empty methods (Rails conventions again!)</p>

<p>before_action is usually used for two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>to set up instance variable for action</p></li>
<li><p>redirect based on some condition</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Non-stadard flow</h3>

<p>The path we want here is: /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
      - @post needs to be an existing object (we&rsquo;re on show post page, so that&rsquo;s okat)
      - @comment needs to be a new object</p>

<h2>Sum Up</h2>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Quite some notes, as I look at it right now. I know that it&rsquo;s not too pretty (and really chaotic!), I&rsquo;m making notes in my text editor (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime 3</a>) and formatting it would take a lot of my precious time ;) But it&rsquo;s the content that matters, right? The least I could do was to extract and format the code, which I did with a help of a cool Wordpress plugin I just found yesterday, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/codecolorer/">CodeColorer</a>.</p>

<p>The video lasted for about 2.5 hours (split into two parts) and is just one in a series that there are in each Tealeaf course.</p>

    <p>After writing a post here yesterday (<a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-2-course-1-done/">Tealeaf Progress Check No. 2 – Course 1 Done!</a>), I went back to review the course 1 for the last time and found out that there was a new task to be done, building a simple command line TicTacToe game. As exercises is definitely something I need, I instantly decided that I want to try and write this of course :) Couple of hours later (and with a little help from the video on how to tackle this), my game was ready. I figured this should be a good piece of code to share as the first of hopefully many more here on the blog. So here it is:</p>

<p>Computer&rsquo;s decision are random at this point, implementing some AI for this is probably beyond me right now. But I&rsquo;d love to go back to this little game some time from now and add this feature. This can also be very easily changed into a game for two players, which would work nicely (no AI needed there!).</p>

    </p>
    <p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m through with the Ruby course and I feel I should do a little sum up of that one. I actually finished about a week ago and am now well into the Rails (second) course, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of myself</p>

<h2>A Bit About the Course</h2>

<p>So before I started the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a> I had basically zero Ruby knowledge. Haven&rsquo;t written a single line of code in Ruby. I was cruising through the course a little faster than the program suggests (it took me about 3 weeks altogether, including pre-course) but that was due to the fact that I had a lot of free time and was putting every second of that into learning Ruby. So do I feel I mastered the language after the course? Well, no, not really. But I do feel I can understand the code I read (for the most part). This is something that Tealeaf really excel in. Chris is doing a great job in explaining how everything works together. But I kind of wished that there was a little bit more of practice exercises. Yes, it is a valid point that practice is something I can do on my own, but still. I would love it there was more simple things that we had built throughout the course that would really helps the gained knowledge stick for good. One more thing I didn&rsquo;t like too much was that even though we built three programs/apps during the course, each of them was a Blackjack game. Sure, they were not the same, since we were using different concepts and tools on the way, but again, a little more variance here would be great. These things are something Tealeaf guys should probably do better in the future. Overall though, I have to say I was not disappointed by the course at all. I learned a lot. I learned in a nice, structured way. I learned fast. And it was fun!</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<p>So let&rsquo;s move on to what I was able to learn. Starting with Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>how to install Ruby and it&rsquo;s gems and how they work</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby syntax and style</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby basics: variables (and their scope, methods, iterations, basic objects (arrays &amp; hashes), classes and more)</p></li>
<li><p>procedural and OOP in Ruby</p></li>
<li><p>how to tie all these concepts together to create a working program</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Aside of Ruby, I also learned a lot of stuff on the side:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git and Github</p></li>
<li><p>choosing and working with text/code editor</p></li>
<li><p>basics of command line</p></li>
<li><p>pseudo code</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP protocol</p></li>
<li><p>HTML and CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript and jQuery</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap front-end framework</p></li>
<li><p>Sinatra Ruby framework</p></li>
<li><p>Heroku deployment</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And most importantly, I learned how to solve problems/bugs on my own. And if I am not able to do so, how to explain the problem I&rsquo;m having to more experienced programmers, so that they would be able to help me.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it was a lot of stuff in a very short time. I still don&rsquo;t feel super comfortable using all of that stuff, but I can now use this knowledge and gain practice on my own. I definitely need to look for a few simple Ruby programs that I can try to write on my own. I also need to review the things I&rsquo;m not 100% sure about and try to understand them fully when I have a while to spare. Oh, and I guess I should start posting some code on the blog as well!</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m not stopping here and am now going further with Rails. Loving it so far!</p>
