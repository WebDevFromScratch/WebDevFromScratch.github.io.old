    <p>I did not come up with that title (maybe you figured by the quotes). I found a great blog post that explains what is the &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a pretty good read in itself and it addresses the case so well: <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Stevey&rsquo;s Blog Rants</a>.</p>

<p>I was actually already looking for ways to learn how to touchtype. I tried it once before a few months ago but I lacked persistence then. After reading Steve&rsquo;s post I don&rsquo;t anymore. I&rsquo;m not writing all that slow to be honest, but my technique is far from perfect. And I know this is something I simply need if I want to have a headstart in any type of programming career. So I practiced for the last four days, 30 minutes each day. And I&rsquo;m going to carry on for at least the next month and see where it takes me!</p>

<h2>Typingweb</h2>

<p>Looking for a tool that would help me here, I came across <a href="http://www.typingweb.com/">typingweb</a>. It&rsquo;s a great place where you can start learning touchtyping straight away, without the needÂ  of even downloading anything. There are free courses for beginners and advanced. Seems pretty cool to me! I&rsquo;ll post an update afer some time to see how my writing speed developed.</p>

    <p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s high time to start really doing something real! I am already engaged in a few non-commercial projects, but here&rsquo;s my highest priority for some time to come: make Web Developer from Scratch my personal, custom website.</p>

<p>While I have nothing against the WordPress theme I started here on (I actually think it&rsquo;s looking really nice(Hexa theme, I&rsquo;ll make some screenshot before I change looks to keep the good memories)), I did already see a couple blogs running on the very same one. Well, I want mine to be personalized. Plus, I want to do a little showing-off my web development skills ;)</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Okay, so what I plan on doing here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build a cool home page (already started on this)</p></li>
<li><p>Buy a .com domain and setting it all up again there</p></li>
<li><p>Make other pages I&rsquo;ll likely need (blog page + posts, about and contact pages and another one where I could show my work)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just a 3 point, very simple plan. I&rsquo;m really excited as this will be the very first website I&rsquo;d do totally from scratch up to working stage. Needless to say I probably don&rsquo;t know everything I need for doing so but I&rsquo;ll be learning in the process. And after I&rsquo;m done I&rsquo;ll have something to show my potential future employer right there, so motivation is high. I actually hope to be able to find my first job in the industry in a few months, so definitely need a portfolio.</p>

<p>Not rambling any longer, let&rsquo;s get to work!</p>

    <p>Hi there!</p>

<p>This is the first post on this soon-to-be-very-cool-and-popular (lol, probably not!) website, so I am kind of excited about this. The site is supposed to be a way of keeping track of my progress in the web development world. Hopefully, it sticks with me for good and a few years from now I&rsquo;ll look at this post and think: &ldquo;Thank god I founded this site!&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s cut the crap and start properly. My name is Piotr, currently 28 year-old Polish guy. I have done various different stuff in my life so far, some exiting, others not too much. The important thing here is that until a few months ago I had totally zero knowledge about web development. I was never too bad with computers, but before I haven&rsquo;t really put my &ldquo;talents&rdquo; to good use. This changed though and I&rsquo;ve been really loving it since I started!</p>

<h2>A Little Bit of Background</h2>

<p>So, why web development? Well, as I said, I&rsquo;ve been doing other things before (another story, not going to bore you with this today) and while they have been interesting too, I realized at some point that I haven&rsquo;t really created anything in my life. Never have I built anything real, that made impact on the world and maybe helped someone in a way by doing so. I was just dealing with numbers, one way or another. And I had enough. It was time to finally make something that exists. Then there was only a question &ldquo;How?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I searched for something that would fit me well and I could possibly be good at. I had just this vague concept of &ldquo;creating&rdquo; as a start. Quickly I realized that things like building something physical in a real world, like a house for example, would not be all that easy. So naturally I wandered in the &ldquo;digital&rdquo; way. And that&rsquo;s pretty much in short how I got to this point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning for this past few months. And I&rsquo;ve been learning hard. Yet I know I barely scratched the surface so far. I know HTML/CSS, some JavaScript (and jQuery) and a little bit of Python. Nothing too serious yet, but even with that limited knowledge I feel like I have powers to really make something of it. And that feels great!</p>

<h2>What Can You Expect Here</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to document my way from here on on this very website. Hopefully, if you decide to follow, you might learn something along. Since I am just a beginner, I will likely be writing in a language that everyone who has not much in common with web development could understand.</p>

<p>Okay, I think this is more than enough for a short introduction. Next posts to follow soon. To the long and productive journey!</p>
