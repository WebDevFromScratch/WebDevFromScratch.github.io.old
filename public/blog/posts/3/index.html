    </p>
    <p>So I finished first two weeks&#8217; material from the first <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> course. Time for some first impressions is due!</p>

<h2>Procedural vs OOP</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;ve learned through this time.</p>

<p>First of all, it really is true that the more time you have for it, the faster you&rsquo;ll finish the course. It took me about 10 days to finish those first two weeks + pre-course. And pre-course is basically designed as a material for an additional week. So it&rsquo;s fair to say I was speeding through it quite nicely so far. But I have been really putting in the time. I haven&rsquo;t been tracking it or anything but most of my days I spent sitting in front of my computer from early morning right until well after dark (I did have breaks during the day though, sometimes they were pretty long - but still I was kind of thinking &lsquo;programming&rsquo; the whole time). I also had some advantage because the project we&rsquo;re building (Blackjack) is really something I did in the Python <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> course not too long ago. I was also introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a> before I started here (during the very same Python course). That definitely gave me a head start and I could focus on the most important thing at the beginning (in my opinion).</p>

<h2>Basics of Ruby</h2>

<p>This thing is of course learning the basics of Ruby programming language. Ruby is a foundation of Rails framework, so to learn Rails one should first (at least) familiarize oneself with Ruby. I have to say I really like how Tealeaf goes about it (I know, praising them again, but it&rsquo;s deserved so far). They wrote their own introduction book, which lays the backgrounds nicely. You learn the syntax and methods while doing (not too hard) exercises at the end of each chapter. I like that I was able to pick it up quite fast and move straight to writing my own first program in Ruby, which was the Blackjack project.</p>

<p>We done it two ways, first using procedural code and then OOP. I have to say I am already falling in love with OOP. Once again, I have to say Tealeaf did their job very nicely explaining how to use OOP in Ruby and most importantly, why to use it at all. As I said before, with my limited programming experience, I was able to go through this pretty smoothly, with just a little help from TAs on the forum.</p>

<p>I understand it&rsquo;s different for everyone and if you have an absolute zero programming experience, this would probably take a little more time and effort to accomplish. Fortunately, the course materials are structured in a way that you can learn with the help of solution videos. You may think it&rsquo;s not that effective, but I can guarantee you it works. I learned Python by mostly leaning on help from videos and code from others and I could see the difference now, I can do a lot of stuff that I wouldn&rsquo;t actually expect me to on my own.</p>

<h2>Week Three</h2>

<p>I moved to week three and well&hellip; I&rsquo;m confused so far. The material touches on a lot of new subjects, like details of the HTTP protocol (I never even though about how it works, always just took it all for granted) and Sinatra framework. My edge I had for the first two weeks of the course is gone. I&rsquo;ve watched the lectures for the material, did some required reading and I guess I need to go through it once more. I can feel I picked some stuff up but I&rsquo;m not yet comfortable enough to start building the browser version of Blackjack, which is this week&rsquo;s goal. I have to say though that I love one thing -Â  I really start to feel like a developer a little bit by learning stuff kind of on the side of programming but much needed in the web environment. That&rsquo;s giving me an additional boost I really need now!</p>

    </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet for quite a while now. I got kind of lost in the process of learning so many various things related to web development, that I forgot about what I initially aimed for. And that is, building real things. Until recently, I tried so many different things and with each of these tools (languages, frameworks, whatever have you), I only barely scratched the surface. Luckily, I finally realized that it&rsquo;s not the best way to go about it all. I realized what I should&rsquo;ve been doing from the start is trying to master one thing. And if I succeed, then try something else. So I tried to follow this approach and actually become good at something.</p>

<h2>Dig Deeper</h2>

<p>I decided I should learn one language first. But not just &ldquo;go through some online tutorial&rdquo; learn. Learn it for real. Then go look for a job using that language and progress further. Still not knowing much about how to do it, I found a cool <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython">Python course at a popular MOOCs site Coursera</a> (if you&rsquo;re not sure what MOOC is, check this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">wikipedia page</a>). I can&rsquo;t say anything bad about it at all, to be honest. I like the approach (building games), the lecturers (Steve is simply hilarious!), forums and all, yet there was one thing that wouldn&rsquo;t stop bothering me. I was learning and having fun with it, but I had no idea how to put all that knowledge to good use in my soon-to-happen (LOL!) web development career. I ditched the final two-week long project and started to look for something that would suit my needs better.</p>

<h2>Bootcamps</h2>

<p>I got introduced to the idea of web development bootcamps. How do they work? In essence, you spend 3-4 months learning how to program in a given language, under the guidance of experience instructors (and learning many other related thins along the way). After that period, they (your former instructors) will likely introduce you to an employer. And bang - you just started your career as a developer. Sounds nice, right? Obviously, these camps do not come free, but it&rsquo;s an investments worth the price (which varies from around $5k to something like $20k). The thing is, those bootcamps seem to be very popular in the US, but not that much in other parts of the world (yet!)*.</p>

<p>Still, I was hooked to the idea. I started to evaluate my options for something similar online. There is actually quite some choice. After googling for a while, reading a bunch of reviews and doing comparisons on my own, I decided to settle on <a href="https://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a>.</p>

<h2>Tealeaf Academy</h2>

<p>What attracted me to it? For starters, I like the approach of dividing the whole learning material into three courses. If you are not a total beginner, you can start from the second or a third one. Plus, you don&rsquo;t have to pay for all of it at once. You pay for each module (course) separately, so I only needed to spend like $500 to get started with the first one.**</p>

<p>Secondly, I love how they don&rsquo;t try to lure you in only to get your money. When you do your research, you&rsquo;ll see that Tealeaf representatives often use phrases like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for everyone&rdquo;, &ldquo;it might not suit you&rdquo;, &ldquo;for some people, other options might be better&rdquo;. They know that actually taking their courses involves a lot of self-discipline and motivation. You really need to be willing to do the job on your own if you are to accomplish their programme.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there are no set, hard deadlines. Tealeaf guys understand well that not everyone has the same amount of time in hand. Each course is divided into weeks, but you can spend as much time on each week as you want. You only have 10 hours a week to spend on the course? No problem. You want to go at it full-time and finish well ahead of everyone else? Sure, why not. I love this because I don&rsquo;t have the same amount of free time every week, it varies. So whenever I can, I learn and if I need to do something else, the course is not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Another thing. When you have a question, you ask it in a forums and one of the TAs will answer you often in a matter of minutes, so you can continue working on your code almost straight away. You don&rsquo;t need to wait for a specific day in the week, when you have your session with a mentor scheduled (that&rsquo;s how <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc</a>, another popular &ldquo;bootcampy&rdquo; site does it). I guess this depends on what you prefer, for me the forums is clearly a better fit.</p>

<p>Finally, Tealeaf promises you moneyback option if you happen not to like how they go about stuff. That&rsquo;s a big sign of confidence in their own learning methods.</p>

<p>Oh, and I almost forgot. THE MOST IMPORTANT: after completing all three courses, you should be able to build your own app using Ruby on Rails. And make it fully working on the web. That&rsquo;s exactly what I needed!***</p>

<h2>So Where am I?</h2>

<p>Well, not too far yet. I&rsquo;m only after pre-course and week 1 of the first course and tackling the material of the second. I actually am finding out, that my previous Coursera Python course is a big help right now. It appears that when you once figure out how programmers think, the language doesn&rsquo;t matter that much (but granted, Python and Ruby are quite similar, in my opinion at least).</p>

<p>Starting a blog was actually one of the assignments/advice in the first week of the course. And I&rsquo;m glad it was there, because I seriously don&rsquo;t know if I would be writing here in the future if not for that&hellip; There will likely be a lot of Ruby (and Rails as I progress) related stuff here from now on but I&rsquo;ll try to post some useful stuff regarding other things as well from time to time. I actually have quite a large base of useful links that I gathered over that few months of my learning, so hopefully you might find some useful stuff if you&rsquo;re not Ruby-focused, too.</p>

<hr/>


<p>*To my surprise, I actually found out there are some options in Poland as well. For example <a href="http://coderslab.pl/">Coders Lab</a>. Still, itâs more expensive than Tealeaf, seems to cover less material and I would likely need to move to Warsaw (there is a weekend course, but it lasts for 16 weekends â no way I could have so many in a row free of other arrangements).</p>

<p>**By the way, price for all three courses is quite advantegous too.</p>

<p>***No, I am not associated with Tealeaf in any other way than learning from them. I do love their stuff and I simply wrote what I think of them.</p>

    <p>I did not come up with that title (maybe you figured by the quotes). I found a great blog post that explains what is the &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a pretty good read in itself and it addresses the case so well: <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Stevey&rsquo;s Blog Rants</a>.</p>

<p>I was actually already looking for ways to learn how to touchtype. I tried it once before a few months ago but I lacked persistence then. After reading Steve&rsquo;s post I don&rsquo;t anymore. I&rsquo;m not writing all that slow to be honest, but my technique is far from perfect. And I know this is something I simply need if I want to have a headstart in any type of programming career. So I practiced for the last four days, 30 minutes each day. And I&rsquo;m going to carry on for at least the next month and see where it takes me!</p>

<h2>Typingweb</h2>

<p>Looking for a tool that would help me here, I came across <a href="http://www.typingweb.com/">typingweb</a>. It&rsquo;s a great place where you can start learning touchtyping straight away, without the needÂ  of even downloading anything. There are free courses for beginners and advanced. Seems pretty cool to me! I&rsquo;ll post an update afer some time to see how my writing speed developed.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s high time to start really doing something real! I am already engaged in a few non-commercial projects, but here&rsquo;s my highest priority for some time to come: make Web Developer from Scratch my personal, custom website.</p>

<p>While I have nothing against the WordPress theme I started here on (I actually think it&rsquo;s looking really nice(Hexa theme, I&rsquo;ll make some screenshot before I change looks to keep the good memories)), I did already see a couple blogs running on the very same one. Well, I want mine to be personalized. Plus, I want to do a little showing-off my web development skills ;)</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Okay, so what I plan on doing here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build a cool home page (already started on this)</p></li>
<li><p>Buy a .com domain and setting it all up again there</p></li>
<li><p>Make other pages I&rsquo;ll likely need (blog page + posts, about and contact pages and another one where I could show my work)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just a 3 point, very simple plan. I&rsquo;m really excited as this will be the very first website I&rsquo;d do totally from scratch up to working stage. Needless to say I probably don&rsquo;t know everything I need for doing so but I&rsquo;ll be learning in the process. And after I&rsquo;m done I&rsquo;ll have something to show my potential future employer right there, so motivation is high. I actually hope to be able to find my first job in the industry in a few months, so definitely need a portfolio.</p>

<p>Not rambling any longer, let&rsquo;s get to work!</p>
