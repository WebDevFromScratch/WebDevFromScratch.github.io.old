<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I finished first two weeks&#8217; material from the first <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> course. Time for some first impressions is due!</p>

<h2>Procedural vs OOP</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;ve learned through this time.</p>

<p>First of all, it really is true that the more time you have for it, the faster you&rsquo;ll finish the course. It took me about 10 days to finish those first two weeks + pre-course. And pre-course is basically designed as a material for an additional week. So it&rsquo;s fair to say I was speeding through it quite nicely so far. But I have been really putting in the time. I haven&rsquo;t been tracking it or anything but most of my days I spent sitting in front of my computer from early morning right until well after dark (I did have breaks during the day though, sometimes they were pretty long - but still I was kind of thinking &lsquo;programming&rsquo; the whole time). I also had some advantage because the project we&rsquo;re building (Blackjack) is really something I did in the Python <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> course not too long ago. I was also introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a> before I started here (during the very same Python course). That definitely gave me a head start and I could focus on the most important thing at the beginning (in my opinion).</p>

<h2>Basics of Ruby</h2>

<p>This thing is of course learning the basics of Ruby programming language. Ruby is a foundation of Rails framework, so to learn Rails one should first (at least) familiarize oneself with Ruby. I have to say I really like how Tealeaf goes about it (I know, praising them again, but it&rsquo;s deserved so far). They wrote their own introduction book, which lays the backgrounds nicely. You learn the syntax and methods while doing (not too hard) exercises at the end of each chapter. I like that I was able to pick it up quite fast and move straight to writing my own first program in Ruby, which was the Blackjack project.</p>

<p>We done it two ways, first using procedural code and then OOP. I have to say I am already falling in love with OOP. Once again, I have to say Tealeaf did their job very nicely explaining how to use OOP in Ruby and most importantly, why to use it at all. As I said before, with my limited programming experience, I was able to go through this pretty smoothly, with just a little help from TAs on the forum.</p>

<p>I understand it&rsquo;s different for everyone and if you have an absolute zero programming experience, this would probably take a little more time and effort to accomplish. Fortunately, the course materials are structured in a way that you can learn with the help of solution videos. You may think it&rsquo;s not that effective, but I can guarantee you it works. I learned Python by mostly leaning on help from videos and code from others and I could see the difference now, I can do a lot of stuff that I wouldn&rsquo;t actually expect me to on my own.</p>

<h2>Week Three</h2>

<p>I moved to week three and well&hellip; I&rsquo;m confused so far. The material touches on a lot of new subjects, like details of the HTTP protocol (I never even though about how it works, always just took it all for granted) and Sinatra framework. My edge I had for the first two weeks of the course is gone. I&rsquo;ve watched the lectures for the material, did some required reading and I guess I need to go through it once more. I can feel I picked some stuff up but I&rsquo;m not yet comfortable enough to start building the browser version of Blackjack, which is this week&rsquo;s goal. I have to say though that I love one thing -Â  I really start to feel like a developer a little bit by learning stuff kind of on the side of programming but much needed in the web environment. That&rsquo;s giving me an additional boost I really need now!</p>
