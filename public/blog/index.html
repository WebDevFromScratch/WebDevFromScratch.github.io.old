    <p><a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">Last time</a> I reported I&rsquo;ll be taking a few days off Tealeaf to practice my skills by building something on my own. While I thought I&rsquo;d be able to accomplish more, I have to say that after six days of hard work (I think I put about 30-35 hours into this) I was able to build a relatively simple, yet still useful ToDo list app. Yeah, I know - everyone is writing todo lists, nothing new under the sun, everybody could do it, etc. Well you know what? Maybe so, but this is the first real, working app that I built totally from scratch. And I&rsquo;m f*cking happy about it :)</p>

<h2>ToDo!</h2>

<p>So what exactly did I put into the app? Well, my goal was to practice the basics, so there&rsquo;s no incredible features, shining effects, stunning graphics, and all that. The idea was, that the user should be able to create his/her own account, where he/she could add tasks to do and mark them &lsquo;accomplished&rsquo; after they are done. Simple as that. Of course, this was not enough when I wrote these basic features, so I figured I could add something more.</p>

<p>I added categories for tasks and the ability for user to create his own categories if he&rsquo;d like. I also added priorities, so tasks could be sorted by their importance. Finally, I figured a way of how to use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html">Ruby Date</a> so tasks can be shown for each day (I also added deadlines for tasks). In the very end I took advantage of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to made it look a little better (I tried with <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> first, but it&rsquo;s not as intuitive as I heard it is).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still nothing great, obviously. But the thing is, it served my purpose very well. I got another confidence boost about how much I&rsquo;ve learned through these couple of months I&rsquo;ve worked with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. And I am convinced I could implement more features into this app, it would be just a matter of how long would it take. With basic Ruby and Rails knowledge, plus using Google, one could really accomplish a lot. I had more ideas for this app, but figured I&rsquo;d better get back to learning before building something more complicated next time.</p>

<h2>Play with It!</h2>

<p>If you wonder how does the app look, you can see a little preview on the screenshot attached to this post. And you can check it out yourself, if you like! I deployed it to <a href="http://herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> production environment, where you can see the working version. Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://intense-reaches-6598.herokuapp.com/">My ToDo! App on Heroku</a></strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to see how the code looks, no problem either. Just take a look at the repo on my Github:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch/todo-app">My ToDo! App Code on Github</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about it, shoot me a comment.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>After those few days break for writing the app, I registered for the third Tealeaf course, which focuses on TDD for the large part. I&rsquo;m already past pre-course and am about to wrap the first week in one or two days. So far, it&rsquo;s been great! The teaching style changed along with the main lecturer. There&rsquo;s no holding hands anymore, people who take this course are assumed to know basic Rails and know how to do certain tasks. Explaining new things is also reduced, so that we can figure out most of it ourselves. And I have to say I love this attitude! Of course if I get stuck, there are always TAs available to help on the forums. One thing I&rsquo;m disappointed with, is how empty the forums appear&hellip; People don&rsquo;t seem to be willing to talk much there, compared to previous courses. Maybe this will change over time though.</p>

<p>About the blog, <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">last time</a> I wrote about some plans I had for it. I was thinking about writing a blogging app from scratch but after putting some more thought to it, this is probably not the best idea, there are many problems with this I could think off the top of my head even now. Plus, all the time I wanted to give to practice was gone working on the ToDo! app. Still, I don&rsquo;t fully like how this site looks rigth now. I&rsquo;ll likely switch to some other theme, maybe leave <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for good. I also would like to add some pages, like &lsquo;about me&rsquo;, resources I like and recommend and stuff like that. Oh yeah, and I want to stop being lazy here and update more often :P I really want to write this series about basic Rails and I do need to start working on this, so here&rsquo;s my promise to myself: I&rsquo;ll be writing at least one post a week here on WebDevFromScratch (let&rsquo;s say for two months, as a beginning). Let&rsquo;s end this post with that.</p>

<p>Fruitful learning!</p>

    </p>
    <p>Yeah, I was finally able to wrap the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a> course up! It was a lot of work for me, not everything is yet superclear. But I definitely learned a lot and now it&rsquo;s all a matter of practice, so the freshly aquired knowledge could sunk in for good. That&rsquo;s why I decided that before I start the third (and final) course, I should build some stuff on my own, as I mentioned in <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/crawling-forward-with-rails/">my last post</a>. Let me sum up the course, as I did the <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-2-course-1-done/">first one</a>.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>The course is intended as a thorought introduction to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework and it definitely fulfills that and more. Again, I can tell you from a perspective of a guy who has zero previous experience with Rails, that you can absolutely go from a mindblow to a somewhat competent level in a month with this Tealeaf course. The learning is tied with building your first app and with each week you dive deeper into the framework. As a precourse exercise, you learn how easy it is to just go with Rails generators and built stuff this way. Then along the course you learn why this is actually not the best way to go about it and how to do it properly.</p>

<p>The second course is definitely way harder than the first one, it requires more work from you and more time as well. I often found myself not understanding the concepts and having to re-watch the video lectures a few times before I finally grasped it (but hey, maybe that&rsquo;s just me). I estimate I put almost twice as much time into learning compared to the first course. In the end though, I feel great about how much I was able to take from it and I definitely feel a little dangerous when it comes to Rails now. And again, I had tons of fun learning!</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Request/Response in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>MVC in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Migrations</p></li>
<li><p>Associations (1:M, M:M, polymorphic)</p></li>
<li><p>RESTful (resourceful) routing</p></li>
<li><p>Model-backed and non-model-backed forms</p></li>
<li><p>Helpers</p></li>
<li><p>Partials</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication from scratch</p></li>
<li><p>Intro to APIs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And much more in the process! I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how hard it was (and to a point, still is) but also truly fulfilling. I realize how much I still don&rsquo;t know and I can&rsquo;t wait to learn as much as I can in the near future.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>As I said, I will be taking a few days break now to build some stuff. I plan on starting with a simple &lsquo;ToDo&rsquo; list app. And then I will try to create a blogging up and move my blog there. This will definitely be much harder and I&rsquo;m not sure I will be able to accomplish this, but I&rsquo;m going to try either way. I&rsquo;ll maybe also work on some other apps on the way, depending on how much time will those two take.</p>

<p>Then I will start the third course, which is supposed to take 8-10 weeks. It&rsquo;s promised to be twice as hard as this one, so I&rsquo;ll definitely have my struggles with it. When I&rsquo;m around mid-way through with it, I&rsquo;ll likely start scoping the market for opportunities for my first job as a junior developer.</p>

<p>I also plan on writing a series of posts detailing what I learned through the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> course, with code examples and explanations. Hopefully this will help some people who are this one step behind me on their way to Rails developer (and definitely will help remembering what I learned).</p>

<p>So lots of stuff to do. Let&rsquo;s better get to work! Over and out!</p>

    <p>This will likely be a random rant about what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last week or so. I feel really tired and don&rsquo;t have a real plan for a post right now but I do feel it&rsquo;s been quiet here for too long and I need to try and keep at least some consistency if this blog is to prevail.</p>

<h2>Never Stop TeaLeaf-ing</h2>

<p>No surprises here, I carry on with the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. I&rsquo;ve been taking a little more time on each subject lately, but I really feel like the knowledge sticks with me more often and it all start to tie together for real. I have one last week left on the second course and am now 100% sure I&rsquo;m going to keep learning with the final one.</p>

<p>Even though I kind of feel I could have learned all I&rsquo;ve learned so far on my own, I&rsquo;m also quite convinced it would take me (at least) twice as much time. And time is of the highest value to me. I do love how the curriculum is structured and how we dive deeper at some places, really getting to know how Rails ties many technologies together. I also love how we learn how to make things from scratch and really understand what we&rsquo;re doing, instead of relying on various gems from the start. I do have some &lsquo;buts&rsquo; as well, though I&rsquo;m going to leave them until I write a sum up post of the second course.</p>

<h2>Odin is Calling</h2>

<p>In regards to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, I didn&rsquo;t really do anything here since the last time, so not much to write about. I do have big plans for it though, as I really see the potential to take a lot from it. Hopefully, next update on TOP will provide more content.</p>

<h2>Time to Build</h2>

<p>Since I finally feel I am able to build simple apps from start to finish, I think this is a good time to start creating some stuff. This will hopefully help me to get my first job some time from now. And I do already have a few ideas up my sleeve that I can start working on and hopefully be able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simple TO-DO app (never really found one that suits me well)</li>
<li>Personal Finance Tracker (as above)</li>
<li>Two apps that I&rsquo;ve found as an initial challenge for an internship/junior dev job (those should be a good practice of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far)</li>
<li>Building a blog from scratch using Rails (<a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/1st-project-lets-go/">I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this!</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>I plan on spending 1-2 hrs a day building those. Hopefully this will make most of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far really stick and become natural.</p>

<h2>Meetup Time</h2>

<p>Tommorow I&rsquo;m going to my first live Ruby meetup (with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/">KRUG</a>) and am pretty excited about it. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to expect from it but I do hope to meet some more experienced developers and see where that might take me. Also, there&rsquo;s supposed to be free beer, so who wouldn&rsquo;t go? ;) I&rsquo;ll report on how the meetup went soon.</p>

    <p>Just a short post, that shows two ways of implementing checkbox feature in a Rails form. First using <strong>check_box_tag</strong> helper. I have to say I was quite happy getting to this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% Category.all.each </span><span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cat</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%= cat.name %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">check_box_tag</span> <span class="ss">:category_ids</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="n">cat</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="vi">@post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cat</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;post[category_ids][]&#39;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But then I discovered there is a more elegant way, using <strong>collection_check_boxes</strong>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">collection_check_boxes</span> <span class="ss">:post</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_ids</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Category</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_name</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yup, just that accomplishes pretty much the same. Below a more elegant way, with labels added. Also, the object is already set (as &lsquo;f&rsquo;) by our model backed form (see below, under (&lsquo;Form&rsquo;)):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collection_check_boxes</span> <span class="ss">:category_ids</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Category</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_name</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cb</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;% cb.label {cb.check_box + cb.text} %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% end </span><span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Form</h2>

<p>These snippets above assumes we have this form set up:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_for @post do |f| %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  #our code goes here</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span> <span class="n">action_description</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">class</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;btn btn-primary&#39;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above checkboxes describes <strong>has_many :through</strong> relationship, between <strong>Post</strong> and <strong>Category</strong> classes (models).</p>

<p>More on Rails helpers for checkboxes can be found in the various docs, for example on <a href="http://apidock.com/">Apidock</a>: <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper/check_box_tag">check_box_tag</a>, <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/v4.0.2/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper/collection_check_boxes">collection_check_boxes</a></p>

    <p>So I&rsquo;ve been having some time off learning. I stayed at my family&rsquo;s for almost a week and when I came back, it was my time to be a host for the weekend. My study time suffered a hard blow. I did what I could, but it wasn&rsquo;t much. The last two days though have been very fruitful learning-wise and I feel like I&rsquo;m regaining the good rhytm again. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish since the last blog post.</p>

<h2>The Odin Project</h2>

<p>As I promised <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/become-a-web-developer-for-free/">the last time</a>, I decided to check <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> while I was away. Of course I had less time than I hoped (don&rsquo;t even ask&hellip;). Still, I did make some progress with it. I skimmed through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101">&lsquo;Web Development 101&rsquo;</a> and dived into <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/">&lsquo;Ruby Programming&rsquo;</a> section.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;m already not too bad with my Ruby skills, but TOP exercises proved me wrong. Due to time constraints, I was only able to complete the basic &lsquo;Building Blocks&rsquo; part. And it was not easy&hellip; After doing some required reading (Very helpful! I not only refreshed my knowledge, but learned a few new tricks) I tried to tackle the building part. &lsquo;Estimated time: 3-5 hrs&rsquo; did not apply to me. I didn&rsquo;t measured it anyhow, but I think it was more like 7 hrs in my case. And I don&rsquo;t think my code is too great. I had to rely on the help from google quite a few times. Below are my solutions to the problems from this chapter:</p>

<p>I once got stuck for a really long time (during &lsquo;stockpicker&rsquo;) and thought this is too difficult. But the key was to just set what I need to achieve clearly, using pseudo code and then I just started from scratch again and it was a pretty smooth process from then on. I have to say though that I felt really, really bad having to spend so much time on so little code. I thought I&rsquo;m not that bad at Ruby! I definitely need to carry on with TOP to improve in this area, I will probably set aside one day a week for this.</p>

<h2>Tealeaf</h2>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t do too much in regard to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a>. I&rsquo;m catching on for the last two days though, I refreshed my knowledge by re-reading my notes and watched the lectures vids that appeared in the meanwhile. After that, I started implementing a Twitter-clone app on my own and I was able to get quite far! I feel like I got a good grasp of Rails basics by now and this makes me really happy. I know there&rsquo;s a long way to go from here, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m actually able to make stuff on my own and understand what I&rsquo;m doing. That&rsquo;s exactly what I was expecting from Tealeaf Academy, so I&rsquo;m even more convinced now that what I paid for it is a money well spent.</p>

<p>For the next few days I&rsquo;m going to work some more on my Twitter app and also my Postit app (Reddit clone) implementation. I&rsquo;ll hopefully also catch up with lessons a little, wrap up Week 2 and maybe even do the whole Week 3. I have a lot of time for these this week. Fingers crossed!</p>
