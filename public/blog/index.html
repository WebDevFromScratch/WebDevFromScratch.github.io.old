    <p>Wow, so much dust in here! As if nobody posted here for two months or so. Oh, wait&hellip;</p>

<p>That was a long break for me and I can&rsquo;t say that it was fully planned. I did plan about a month off learning (longer holidays with the fiancee was long due) but after that I lost focus and couldn&rsquo;t go back to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a>. I also got back to my part-time side gig and that took a part of my time, too. But then one must make money somehow to finance the time sacrificed for learning new things.</p>

<p>Overall, I once again feel ready for hard work (and lots of it!). I feel like I need a written plan, though, so I don&rsquo;t lose focus again. And I guess it&rsquo;s best to share that plan on a public forum (that means here, on this very blog), which should cause me being more responsible in sticking to it. I&rsquo;m going to post it as the next entry as soon as I figure this out, maybe I&rsquo;ll be updating the plan on the go, but I need at least a rough one ASAP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for about a week now I was reminding myself the basics of Ruby and Rails again. Boy, I got really rusty during my time off! Right now I&rsquo;m in process of writing a simple blog app to repeat the basic concepts in practice, I&rsquo;ll post a link to it on <a href="https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch">my github</a> once it&rsquo;s done.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Long time no see. I just made a promise to myself <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/building-is-fun/">last time</a> that I will be writing at least one post each week and then go on a 20-day-no-post spell straigh away. Nicely played, man&hellip; It is a holiday season here and I did take a couple days breaks here and there, it&rsquo;s also not like I was doing nothing all the time, so let&rsquo;s get to what happened since last blog post.</p>

<h2>Having Fun with rspec and HAML</h2>

<p>So I wrapped up the first week of the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps">3rd and last Tealeaf course</a>, which took me a little bit longer than I thought. The curriculum focuses strongly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD) in Rails and this first week was a very good introduction. I learned how to use <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> and why it&rsquo;s good to have tests for my apps. It was also a whole new experience, writing a Rails app using tests. I have to say I like this way a lot! It&rsquo;s like first thinking about what each piece of code I&rsquo;m about to write should accomplish, laying out guidlines for it and only afterwards writing this code, so that it fulfills the set requirements. So far, I am a bit confused with tests and I seem to miss some cases writing them on my own. But solution videos are always there to clear any doubts I have any, so I can fix my mistakes on the go. Also, the course forums started to feel more alive as of late (even though I was not a part of it, lol).</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a>. I was really confused about what&rsquo;s going when I first saw mockups for pages wirtten in HAML. And I know that after these breaks I&rsquo;ve been having I will probably go through the confusions all over again (it should be a tad easier this time, hopefully). But after learning the basic rules of it, I love HAML! The markup is so much better than pure HTML, there&rsquo;s a lot less to write and it simply looks prettier when I look at my code! The only thing is, one really needs to be careful about what he&rsquo;s doing. Simple indentation mistake could cause a lot of problems, that seem really hard to catch later on.</p>

<h2>A Whole New Web Developer from Scratch</h2>

<p>This took me a good week, but finally I can say I am done. I decided I had it with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and it&rsquo;s time to move to something else, my new choice being <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on speed, which is <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. It is different than WP, in a way that there&rsquo;s not really a database to work with. It&rsquo;s really a collection of static sites, generated each time when you use a specific rake command in the console.</p>

<p>With the help of instructions that can be found on Octopress docs pages and some google search, I was able to create a brand new blog with it. Next thing to do was to customize the look (<a href="https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3">Octostrap3</a> was exactly what I was looking for, needed only minor tweaking), import my stuff from Wordpress (easy!), deploy to Github pages (easier!) and delegating the comments to 3rd party system - <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> (should be easy, but I had my hard times with this). Just like that, I had my blog re-created from scratch. Neat!</p>

<p>Yet this was not enough. In the pre-course for the 3rd Tealeaf course, there was an exercise to do. Learn jQuery, it said, go to a great tutorial called &ldquo;<a href="http://try.jquery.com/">Try jQuery</a>&rdquo; and have fun. And I did. The tutorial was awesome and even though I had done some jQuery before, I had a great time with it. It&rsquo;s amazing how much can one accomplish on the front-end, knowing only the basics of jQuery. Simple, yet classy effects are extremely easy to create with it&rsquo;s help. Needless to say, after the tutorial I wanted some more practice. Building my personal website seemed like a perfect exercise.</p>

<p>I am not going to write in details how it was done, but you can see the effects here on <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/">Web Developer from Scratch</a>. It was really cool and made me realize that as much as I love writing back-end logic, I like working on the front-end almost just as much. Thus next time, when I write another Rails practice app, I&rsquo;ll also work on it&rsquo;s looks as well afterwards. Should be tons of fun!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not making any promises this time. I have my next few weekend full, so again less time for learning, which is not great. As I said before though, it&rsquo;s not a sprint. I just need to work hard whenever I can (as well as write here!) and that&rsquo;s it. I really miss learning with Tealeaf, so the motivation is there. I need to clean the code for my personal website, too. So far, I focused mostly on making it work and not too much on DRY and cleanliness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started to &lsquo;test the job market waters&rsquo; by sending a couple of resumes out. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure I&rsquo;m ready, but on the other hand I know that I could learn even faster if I got a job at this point. I guess we&rsquo;ll see what comes of it.</p>

<p>Until next!</p>

    </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">Last time</a> I reported I&rsquo;ll be taking a few days off Tealeaf to practice my skills by building something on my own. While I thought I&rsquo;d be able to accomplish more, I have to say that after six days of hard work (I think I put about 30-35 hours into this) I was able to build a relatively simple, yet still useful ToDo list app. Yeah, I know - everyone is writing todo lists, nothing new under the sun, everybody could do it, etc. Well you know what? Maybe so, but this is the first real, working app that I built totally from scratch. And I&rsquo;m f*cking happy about it :)</p>

<h2>ToDo!</h2>

<p>So what exactly did I put into the app? Well, my goal was to practice the basics, so there&rsquo;s no incredible features, shining effects, stunning graphics, and all that. The idea was, that the user should be able to create his/her own account, where he/she could add tasks to do and mark them &lsquo;accomplished&rsquo; after they are done. Simple as that. Of course, this was not enough when I wrote these basic features, so I figured I could add something more.</p>

<p>I added categories for tasks and the ability for user to create his own categories if he&rsquo;d like. I also added priorities, so tasks could be sorted by their importance. Finally, I figured a way of how to use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html">Ruby Date</a> so tasks can be shown for each day (I also added deadlines for tasks). In the very end I took advantage of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to made it look a little better (I tried with <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> first, but it&rsquo;s not as intuitive as I heard it is).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still nothing great, obviously. But the thing is, it served my purpose very well. I got another confidence boost about how much I&rsquo;ve learned through these couple of months I&rsquo;ve worked with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. And I am convinced I could implement more features into this app, it would be just a matter of how long would it take. With basic Ruby and Rails knowledge, plus using Google, one could really accomplish a lot. I had more ideas for this app, but figured I&rsquo;d better get back to learning before building something more complicated next time.</p>

<h2>Play with It!</h2>

<p>If you wonder how does the app look, you can see a little preview on the screenshot attached to this post. And you can check it out yourself, if you like! I deployed it to <a href="http://herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> production environment, where you can see the working version. Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://intense-reaches-6598.herokuapp.com/">My ToDo! App on Heroku</a></strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to see how the code looks, no problem either. Just take a look at the repo on my Github:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch/todo-app">My ToDo! App Code on Github</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about it, shoot me a comment.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>After those few days break for writing the app, I registered for the third Tealeaf course, which focuses on TDD for the large part. I&rsquo;m already past pre-course and am about to wrap the first week in one or two days. So far, it&rsquo;s been great! The teaching style changed along with the main lecturer. There&rsquo;s no holding hands anymore, people who take this course are assumed to know basic Rails and know how to do certain tasks. Explaining new things is also reduced, so that we can figure out most of it ourselves. And I have to say I love this attitude! Of course if I get stuck, there are always TAs available to help on the forums. One thing I&rsquo;m disappointed with, is how empty the forums appear&hellip; People don&rsquo;t seem to be willing to talk much there, compared to previous courses. Maybe this will change over time though.</p>

<p>About the blog, <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">last time</a> I wrote about some plans I had for it. I was thinking about writing a blogging app from scratch but after putting some more thought to it, this is probably not the best idea, there are many problems with this I could think off the top of my head even now. Plus, all the time I wanted to give to practice was gone working on the ToDo! app. Still, I don&rsquo;t fully like how this site looks rigth now. I&rsquo;ll likely switch to some other theme, maybe leave <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for good. I also would like to add some pages, like &lsquo;about me&rsquo;, resources I like and recommend and stuff like that. Oh yeah, and I want to stop being lazy here and update more often :P I really want to write this series about basic Rails and I do need to start working on this, so here&rsquo;s my promise to myself: I&rsquo;ll be writing at least one post a week here on WebDevFromScratch (let&rsquo;s say for two months, as a beginning). Let&rsquo;s end this post with that.</p>

<p>Fruitful learning!</p>

    </p>
    <p>Yeah, I was finally able to wrap the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a> course up! It was a lot of work for me, not everything is yet superclear. But I definitely learned a lot and now it&rsquo;s all a matter of practice, so the freshly aquired knowledge could sunk in for good. That&rsquo;s why I decided that before I start the third (and final) course, I should build some stuff on my own, as I mentioned in <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/crawling-forward-with-rails/">my last post</a>. Let me sum up the course, as I did the <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-2-course-1-done/">first one</a>.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>The course is intended as a thorought introduction to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework and it definitely fulfills that and more. Again, I can tell you from a perspective of a guy who has zero previous experience with Rails, that you can absolutely go from a mindblow to a somewhat competent level in a month with this Tealeaf course. The learning is tied with building your first app and with each week you dive deeper into the framework. As a precourse exercise, you learn how easy it is to just go with Rails generators and built stuff this way. Then along the course you learn why this is actually not the best way to go about it and how to do it properly.</p>

<p>The second course is definitely way harder than the first one, it requires more work from you and more time as well. I often found myself not understanding the concepts and having to re-watch the video lectures a few times before I finally grasped it (but hey, maybe that&rsquo;s just me). I estimate I put almost twice as much time into learning compared to the first course. In the end though, I feel great about how much I was able to take from it and I definitely feel a little dangerous when it comes to Rails now. And again, I had tons of fun learning!</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Request/Response in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>MVC in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Migrations</p></li>
<li><p>Associations (1:M, M:M, polymorphic)</p></li>
<li><p>RESTful (resourceful) routing</p></li>
<li><p>Model-backed and non-model-backed forms</p></li>
<li><p>Helpers</p></li>
<li><p>Partials</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication from scratch</p></li>
<li><p>Intro to APIs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And much more in the process! I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how hard it was (and to a point, still is) but also truly fulfilling. I realize how much I still don&rsquo;t know and I can&rsquo;t wait to learn as much as I can in the near future.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>As I said, I will be taking a few days break now to build some stuff. I plan on starting with a simple &lsquo;ToDo&rsquo; list app. And then I will try to create a blogging up and move my blog there. This will definitely be much harder and I&rsquo;m not sure I will be able to accomplish this, but I&rsquo;m going to try either way. I&rsquo;ll maybe also work on some other apps on the way, depending on how much time will those two take.</p>

<p>Then I will start the third course, which is supposed to take 8-10 weeks. It&rsquo;s promised to be twice as hard as this one, so I&rsquo;ll definitely have my struggles with it. When I&rsquo;m around mid-way through with it, I&rsquo;ll likely start scoping the market for opportunities for my first job as a junior developer.</p>

<p>I also plan on writing a series of posts detailing what I learned through the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> course, with code examples and explanations. Hopefully this will help some people who are this one step behind me on their way to Rails developer (and definitely will help remembering what I learned).</p>

<p>So lots of stuff to do. Let&rsquo;s better get to work! Over and out!</p>

    </p>
    <p>This will likely be a random rant about what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last week or so. I feel really tired and don&rsquo;t have a real plan for a post right now but I do feel it&rsquo;s been quiet here for too long and I need to try and keep at least some consistency if this blog is to prevail.</p>

<h2>Never Stop TeaLeaf-ing</h2>

<p>No surprises here, I carry on with the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. I&rsquo;ve been taking a little more time on each subject lately, but I really feel like the knowledge sticks with me more often and it all start to tie together for real. I have one last week left on the second course and am now 100% sure I&rsquo;m going to keep learning with the final one.</p>

<p>Even though I kind of feel I could have learned all I&rsquo;ve learned so far on my own, I&rsquo;m also quite convinced it would take me (at least) twice as much time. And time is of the highest value to me. I do love how the curriculum is structured and how we dive deeper at some places, really getting to know how Rails ties many technologies together. I also love how we learn how to make things from scratch and really understand what we&rsquo;re doing, instead of relying on various gems from the start. I do have some &lsquo;buts&rsquo; as well, though I&rsquo;m going to leave them until I write a sum up post of the second course.</p>

<h2>Odin is Calling</h2>

<p>In regards to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, I didn&rsquo;t really do anything here since the last time, so not much to write about. I do have big plans for it though, as I really see the potential to take a lot from it. Hopefully, next update on TOP will provide more content.</p>

<h2>Time to Build</h2>

<p>Since I finally feel I am able to build simple apps from start to finish, I think this is a good time to start creating some stuff. This will hopefully help me to get my first job some time from now. And I do already have a few ideas up my sleeve that I can start working on and hopefully be able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simple TO-DO app (never really found one that suits me well)</li>
<li>Personal Finance Tracker (as above)</li>
<li>Two apps that I&rsquo;ve found as an initial challenge for an internship/junior dev job (those should be a good practice of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far)</li>
<li>Building a blog from scratch using Rails (<a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/1st-project-lets-go/">I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this!</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>I plan on spending 1-2 hrs a day building those. Hopefully this will make most of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far really stick and become natural.</p>

<h2>Meetup Time</h2>

<p>Tommorow I&rsquo;m going to my first live Ruby meetup (with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/">KRUG</a>) and am pretty excited about it. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to expect from it but I do hope to meet some more experienced developers and see where that might take me. Also, there&rsquo;s supposed to be free beer, so who wouldn&rsquo;t go? ;) I&rsquo;ll report on how the meetup went soon.</p>
