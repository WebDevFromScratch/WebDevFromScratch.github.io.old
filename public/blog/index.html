    <p class="open-sans-condensed-font bigger-font">Text text text, I can write whatever I want in here. Pretty cool! Gotta go for a little bit longer with this nonsense to create some random bits of text, so that we can test the looks a little bit more. But oh well, that&#8217;s pretty cool still! Okay, one last sentence, especially for you:</p>


<h2>Testing Stuff Out</h2>

<p>I am really digging this Octopress so far! One could achieve a whole lot with it and really make it stand out and look awesome :)</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">Last time</a> I reported I&rsquo;ll be taking a few days off Tealeaf to practice my skills by building something on my own. While I thought I&rsquo;d be able to accomplish more, I have to say that after six days of hard work (I think I put about 30-35 hours into this) I was able to build a relatively simple, yet still useful ToDo list app. Yeah, I know - everyone is writing todo lists, nothing new under the sun, everybody could do it, etc. Well you know what? Maybe so, but this is the first real, working app that I built totally from scratch. And I&rsquo;m f*cking happy about it :)</p>

<h2>ToDo!</h2>

<p>So what exactly did I put into the app? Well, my goal was to practice the basics, so there&rsquo;s no incredible features, shining effects, stunning graphics, and all that. The idea was, that the user should be able to create his/her own account, where he/she could add tasks to do and mark them &lsquo;accomplished&rsquo; after they are done. Simple as that. Of course, this was not enough when I wrote these basic features, so I figured I could add something more.</p>

<p>I added categories for tasks and the ability for user to create his own categories if he&rsquo;d like. I also added priorities, so tasks could be sorted by their importance. Finally, I figured a way of how to use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html">Ruby Date</a> so tasks can be shown for each day (I also added deadlines for tasks). In the very end I took advantage of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to made it look a little better (I tried with <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> first, but it&rsquo;s not as intuitive as I heard it is).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still nothing great, obviously. But the thing is, it served my purpose very well. I got another confidence boost about how much I&rsquo;ve learned through these couple of months I&rsquo;ve worked with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. And I am convinced I could implement more features into this app, it would be just a matter of how long would it take. With basic Ruby and Rails knowledge, plus using Google, one could really accomplish a lot. I had more ideas for this app, but figured I&rsquo;d better get back to learning before building something more complicated next time.</p>

<h2>Play with It!</h2>

<p>If you wonder how does the app look, you can see a little preview on the screenshot attached to this post. And you can check it out yourself, if you like! I deployed it to <a href="http://herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> production environment, where you can see the working version. Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://intense-reaches-6598.herokuapp.com/">My ToDo! App on Heroku</a></strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to see how the code looks, no problem either. Just take a look at the repo on my Github:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch/todo-app">My ToDo! App Code on Github</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about it, shoot me a comment.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>After those few days break for writing the app, I registered for the third Tealeaf course, which focuses on TDD for the large part. I&rsquo;m already past pre-course and am about to wrap the first week in one or two days. So far, it&rsquo;s been great! The teaching style changed along with the main lecturer. There&rsquo;s no holding hands anymore, people who take this course are assumed to know basic Rails and know how to do certain tasks. Explaining new things is also reduced, so that we can figure out most of it ourselves. And I have to say I love this attitude! Of course if I get stuck, there are always TAs available to help on the forums. One thing I&rsquo;m disappointed with, is how empty the forums appear&hellip; People don&rsquo;t seem to be willing to talk much there, compared to previous courses. Maybe this will change over time though.</p>

<p>About the blog, <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">last time</a> I wrote about some plans I had for it. I was thinking about writing a blogging app from scratch but after putting some more thought to it, this is probably not the best idea, there are many problems with this I could think off the top of my head even now. Plus, all the time I wanted to give to practice was gone working on the ToDo! app. Still, I don&rsquo;t fully like how this site looks rigth now. I&rsquo;ll likely switch to some other theme, maybe leave <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for good. I also would like to add some pages, like &lsquo;about me&rsquo;, resources I like and recommend and stuff like that. Oh yeah, and I want to stop being lazy here and update more often :P I really want to write this series about basic Rails and I do need to start working on this, so here&rsquo;s my promise to myself: I&rsquo;ll be writing at least one post a week here on WebDevFromScratch (let&rsquo;s say for two months, as a beginning). Let&rsquo;s end this post with that.</p>

<p>Fruitful learning!</p>

    </p>
    <p>Yeah, I was finally able to wrap the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a> course up! It was a lot of work for me, not everything is yet superclear. But I definitely learned a lot and now it&rsquo;s all a matter of practice, so the freshly aquired knowledge could sunk in for good. That&rsquo;s why I decided that before I start the third (and final) course, I should build some stuff on my own, as I mentioned in <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/crawling-forward-with-rails/">my last post</a>. Let me sum up the course, as I did the <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/tealeaf-progress-check-no-2-course-1-done/">first one</a>.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>The course is intended as a thorought introduction to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework and it definitely fulfills that and more. Again, I can tell you from a perspective of a guy who has zero previous experience with Rails, that you can absolutely go from a mindblow to a somewhat competent level in a month with this Tealeaf course. The learning is tied with building your first app and with each week you dive deeper into the framework. As a precourse exercise, you learn how easy it is to just go with Rails generators and built stuff this way. Then along the course you learn why this is actually not the best way to go about it and how to do it properly.</p>

<p>The second course is definitely way harder than the first one, it requires more work from you and more time as well. I often found myself not understanding the concepts and having to re-watch the video lectures a few times before I finally grasped it (but hey, maybe that&rsquo;s just me). I estimate I put almost twice as much time into learning compared to the first course. In the end though, I feel great about how much I was able to take from it and I definitely feel a little dangerous when it comes to Rails now. And again, I had tons of fun learning!</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Request/Response in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>MVC in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Migrations</p></li>
<li><p>Associations (1:M, M:M, polymorphic)</p></li>
<li><p>RESTful (resourceful) routing</p></li>
<li><p>Model-backed and non-model-backed forms</p></li>
<li><p>Helpers</p></li>
<li><p>Partials</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX in Rails</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication from scratch</p></li>
<li><p>Intro to APIs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And much more in the process! I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how hard it was (and to a point, still is) but also truly fulfilling. I realize how much I still don&rsquo;t know and I can&rsquo;t wait to learn as much as I can in the near future.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>As I said, I will be taking a few days break now to build some stuff. I plan on starting with a simple &lsquo;ToDo&rsquo; list app. And then I will try to create a blogging up and move my blog there. This will definitely be much harder and I&rsquo;m not sure I will be able to accomplish this, but I&rsquo;m going to try either way. I&rsquo;ll maybe also work on some other apps on the way, depending on how much time will those two take.</p>

<p>Then I will start the third course, which is supposed to take 8-10 weeks. It&rsquo;s promised to be twice as hard as this one, so I&rsquo;ll definitely have my struggles with it. When I&rsquo;m around mid-way through with it, I&rsquo;ll likely start scoping the market for opportunities for my first job as a junior developer.</p>

<p>I also plan on writing a series of posts detailing what I learned through the second <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> course, with code examples and explanations. Hopefully this will help some people who are this one step behind me on their way to Rails developer (and definitely will help remembering what I learned).</p>

<p>So lots of stuff to do. Let&rsquo;s better get to work! Over and out!</p>

    <p>This will likely be a random rant about what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last week or so. I feel really tired and don&rsquo;t have a real plan for a post right now but I do feel it&rsquo;s been quiet here for too long and I need to try and keep at least some consistency if this blog is to prevail.</p>

<h2>Never Stop TeaLeaf-ing</h2>

<p>No surprises here, I carry on with the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. I&rsquo;ve been taking a little more time on each subject lately, but I really feel like the knowledge sticks with me more often and it all start to tie together for real. I have one last week left on the second course and am now 100% sure I&rsquo;m going to keep learning with the final one.</p>

<p>Even though I kind of feel I could have learned all I&rsquo;ve learned so far on my own, I&rsquo;m also quite convinced it would take me (at least) twice as much time. And time is of the highest value to me. I do love how the curriculum is structured and how we dive deeper at some places, really getting to know how Rails ties many technologies together. I also love how we learn how to make things from scratch and really understand what we&rsquo;re doing, instead of relying on various gems from the start. I do have some &lsquo;buts&rsquo; as well, though I&rsquo;m going to leave them until I write a sum up post of the second course.</p>

<h2>Odin is Calling</h2>

<p>In regards to <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, I didn&rsquo;t really do anything here since the last time, so not much to write about. I do have big plans for it though, as I really see the potential to take a lot from it. Hopefully, next update on TOP will provide more content.</p>

<h2>Time to Build</h2>

<p>Since I finally feel I am able to build simple apps from start to finish, I think this is a good time to start creating some stuff. This will hopefully help me to get my first job some time from now. And I do already have a few ideas up my sleeve that I can start working on and hopefully be able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simple TO-DO app (never really found one that suits me well)</li>
<li>Personal Finance Tracker (as above)</li>
<li>Two apps that I&rsquo;ve found as an initial challenge for an internship/junior dev job (those should be a good practice of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far)</li>
<li>Building a blog from scratch using Rails (<a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/1st-project-lets-go/">I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this!</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>I plan on spending 1-2 hrs a day building those. Hopefully this will make most of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far really stick and become natural.</p>

<h2>Meetup Time</h2>

<p>Tommorow I&rsquo;m going to my first live Ruby meetup (with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/">KRUG</a>) and am pretty excited about it. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to expect from it but I do hope to meet some more experienced developers and see where that might take me. Also, there&rsquo;s supposed to be free beer, so who wouldn&rsquo;t go? ;) I&rsquo;ll report on how the meetup went soon.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But then I discovered there is a more elegant way, using <strong>collection_check_boxes</strong>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">collection_check_boxes</span> <span class="ss">:post</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_ids</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Category</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_name</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yup, just that accomplishes pretty much the same. Below a more elegant way, with labels added. Also, the object is already set (as &lsquo;f&rsquo;) by our model backed form (see below, under (&lsquo;Form&rsquo;)):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collection_check_boxes</span> <span class="ss">:category_ids</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Category</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:category_name</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cb</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;% cb.label {cb.check_box + cb.text} %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% end </span><span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Form</h2>

<p>These snippets above assumes we have this form set up:</p>

    <p>So I&rsquo;ve been having some time off learning. I stayed at my family&rsquo;s for almost a week and when I came back, it was my time to be a host for the weekend. My study time suffered a hard blow. I did what I could, but it wasn&rsquo;t much. The last two days though have been very fruitful learning-wise and I feel like I&rsquo;m regaining the good rhytm again. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish since the last blog post.</p>

<h2>The Odin Project</h2>

<p>As I promised <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/become-a-web-developer-for-free/">the last time</a>, I decided to check <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> while I was away. Of course I had less time than I hoped (don&rsquo;t even ask&hellip;). Still, I did make some progress with it. I skimmed through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101">&lsquo;Web Development 101&rsquo;</a> and dived into <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/">&lsquo;Ruby Programming&rsquo;</a> section.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;m already not too bad with my Ruby skills, but TOP exercises proved me wrong. Due to time constraints, I was only able to complete the basic &lsquo;Building Blocks&rsquo; part. And it was not easy&hellip; After doing some required reading (Very helpful! I not only refreshed my knowledge, but learned a few new tricks) I tried to tackle the building part. &lsquo;Estimated time: 3-5 hrs&rsquo; did not apply to me. I didn&rsquo;t measured it anyhow, but I think it was more like 7 hrs in my case. And I don&rsquo;t think my code is too great. I had to rely on the help from google quite a few times. Below are my solutions to the problems from this chapter:</p>

<p>I once got stuck for a really long time (during &lsquo;stockpicker&rsquo;) and thought this is too difficult. But the key was to just set what I need to achieve clearly, using pseudo code and then I just started from scratch again and it was a pretty smooth process from then on. I have to say though that I felt really, really bad having to spend so much time on so little code. I thought I&rsquo;m not that bad at Ruby! I definitely need to carry on with TOP to improve in this area, I will probably set aside one day a week for this.</p>

<h2>Tealeaf</h2>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t do too much in regard to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a>. I&rsquo;m catching on for the last two days though, I refreshed my knowledge by re-reading my notes and watched the lectures vids that appeared in the meanwhile. After that, I started implementing a Twitter-clone app on my own and I was able to get quite far! I feel like I got a good grasp of Rails basics by now and this makes me really happy. I know there&rsquo;s a long way to go from here, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m actually able to make stuff on my own and understand what I&rsquo;m doing. That&rsquo;s exactly what I was expecting from Tealeaf Academy, so I&rsquo;m even more convinced now that what I paid for it is a money well spent.</p>

<p>For the next few days I&rsquo;m going to work some more on my Twitter app and also my Postit app (Reddit clone) implementation. I&rsquo;ll hopefully also catch up with lessons a little, wrap up Week 2 and maybe even do the whole Week 3. I have a lot of time for these this week. Fingers crossed!</p>

    </p>
    <p>I have been slacking a bit for the last couple of days. Watching World Cup apparently is not good for my free time! I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too good physically-wise and it wasn&rsquo;t helping either. As with everything in life though, a coin have two sides. For this past month I tried to do everything I could to learn and be that several steps closer to hopefully getting my first web developer job and finally I had a while to gain different perspective.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking lot and figured out that I shouldn&rsquo;t really be speeding through <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses as fast as possible. I should rather focus on making more effort to really grasp the material I&rsquo;m learning and allow it to really sink in. And the best way to do it is again, through practice. I could probably just make some exercises on my own, but I figured I may as well check what the internet has to offer first. Needless to say, I was hoping there were some free (or really cheap) options available. That&rsquo;s how I found out (or rather re-discovered, because I heard about it before) <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

<h2>The Odin Project</h2>

<p>So what is it? Well, in essence <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (or TOP) is not that much different to <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a>. They provide you with a curriculum, which includes a broad range of subjects, form learning the basics about web development, through Ruby and Rails, HTML and CSS and Javascript and it&rsquo;s jQuery library. There is also one more section related to getting your first job as a web developer. Sounds awesome, right? Yeah, I think so too. Especially because TOP is open-source, with constantly evolving curricullum and a nice, helpful community (at least from what I&rsquo;ve heard). Just yesterday I decided that I should see what are they about.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to look closer at it since, but I will have the next few days for doing so. I have to pay a visit to my family and since I won&rsquo;t have my personal machine while I&rsquo;m there (it&rsquo;s a desktop computer), I figured I&rsquo;ll spend the time trying out what TOP has to offer. I should give my first impression about it around the next weekend I guess. I&rsquo;m really excited for it!</p>

<h2>Make it With Code</h2>

<p>During my internet research for alternative learning sources, I also came across <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>. Their credo is something I especially came to like: &ldquo;Learn to Code by Making Things&rdquo;, which sounds like exactly what I was looking for. The idea is, you get a lesson a week, for 10 weeks (lessons are text-format, combining a balance of challenges with instruction). With each lesson you build one working thing. Sounds good to me!</p>

<p>There is one caveat: it&rsquo;s not free. The course costs $99, which isn&rsquo;t all that much considering what I&rsquo;m paying for <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> courses. I will likely be trying it out in the future. I couldn&rsquo;t find too many reviews on <a href="https://www.makeitwithcode.com/">Make it With Code</a>, so if you decide to try it before I do, please let me know if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<h2>And Just a Quick Tealeaf Progress Check</h2>

<p>I am currently about to wrap up the 2nd week of the Rails course. It&rsquo;s not going too smoothy so far. I understand most of the concepts (mostly thanks too the understanding of Ruby, which I gained through the 1st course) but I don&rsquo;t really feel too comfortable in Rails just yet. I think after finishing this course I will try to go through the materials once more and see how much of it I was able to truly absorb.</p>

<p>I have to say though, that I really like what we&rsquo;re building. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>-alike app which has quite a few cool features about it. And we&rsquo;re learning some front-end along, with the use of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> too. I could really see how useful this all could be in the future. I guess I should write a longer post (with code examples) of what I&rsquo;ve learned sometime soon.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, I also noticed some traffic here, on <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com">Web Developer from Scratch</a>, which is likely caused by a cool domain name I was able to pick for it (score!) and google already indexing my little blog. Thus I encourage everyone who visits to leave comments if you have questions or words of encouragement (this really helps!). Or if you are in a similar situation to mine and want to become a web developer starting from nothing. Get in touch!</p>

      <br/>
      


    </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m long due another update on how my progress with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> is going, but I just can&rsquo;t force myself to write it&hellip; Let me just say I dived deep into Rails and am trying to wrap my head around it&rsquo;s magic (actually, there&rsquo;s no magic at all, just conventions that Rails assumes - definitely need to write something about it soon!).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I figured I&rsquo;ll post notes on the latest video lecture I watched. If you stumbled upon this blog of mine and are thinking about joining Tealeaf, this is an example of what we learn there. Making these sort of notes is not mandatory of course, everything you need is in video format. But I like to make them, it helps me memorize more. Okay, no more rambling, move on the notes (these are from Lecture 3 of the Rails course).</p>

<h2>Rails Forms</h2>

<p>sidenote: in Rails we can refer to a key by a symbol (in params hash, for example) even though it&rsquo;s a string (a hash with indifferent access)</p>

<p>Creating a form
- how to do that using 3 ways (on an example of a new (creating) post form)</p>

<h3>1. Pure HTML</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>HTML form</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">&#39;/posts&#39;</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">&#39;POST&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  Title: <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&#39;text&#39;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#39;my_title&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;br/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&#39;submit&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t as a deault work in Rails, because of a &lsquo;protect_from_forgery&rsquo; validation error (if we removed protect_from_forgery from application_controller.rb, this would work)</p>

<p>this is not the best from the point of security of our app</p>

<p>This is the most manual way, we never do this in Rails. We&rsquo;d need to hack our application_controller and we definitely don&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<h3>2. Rails form helper</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Form Helper</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_tag &#39;/posts&#39; do %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">label_tag</span> <span class="ss">:title</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%= text_field_tag :title %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">submit_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Create Post&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this adds authenticity_token (which is hidden in html), which is needed for this &lsquo;protect_from_forgery&rsquo; validation to work
helpers give us these little things that speeds up the work and saves us from some weird edge case errors</p>

<p>label element is correlated with input element (refers to it); is used for screenreaders that recognizes what&rsquo;s what (useful for blind internet users for example, to help them) &lt;&mdash; try to develop a habit of setting label elements</p>

<p>This would work just as the above HTML form.</p>

<h3>3. Rails model-backed form</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Model-Backed Form</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_for @post do |f| %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">label</span> <span class="ss">:title</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Create Post&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>we need to set our @something variable in the controller (PostsController in case of @post) for it to work of course</p>

<p>  it assumes a lot of things for us</p>

<p>  creates an additional nested structure in our session params (adding another nested hash for &lsquo;post&rsquo; key, where it assigns stuff specific to post, like title, etc.)</p>

<p>  naming conventions for how Rails saves these variables to create that nested structure can be seen when inspecting the HTML code (in browser), it has this format: post[title]</p>

<p>  !(that&rsquo;s why in code (especially Rails 3.x) we can see a lot of code that looks like this: Post.new(params[:post]))</p>

<p>  !also, thus we can do a mass assignment to Post object like this: Post.new(&lsquo;title&rsquo;=>&lsquo;some title&rsquo;) or Post.new(title: &lsquo;some title&rsquo;, url: &lsquo;some url&rsquo;) &lt;&mdash; these keys are our setter methods that come from ActiveRecord::Base; essentially that&rsquo;s because we have the columns called that in our database &lsquo;posts&rsquo; table</p>

<p>  we can also use virtual attributes as keys here (like user:, category:, etc. &lt;&mdash; we set associations to these earlier)</p>

<p>  we can&rsquo;t just add random fields here though (like f.text_field :whatever) do to the connection we have with other layers (that Rails assumes) - we can only use variables that we can use mass assignments with (our table columns) as keys</p>

<p>  otherwise the connection (assumption, convention) breaks and we&rsquo;d get a &lsquo;NoMethod&rsquo; error
  we can add whatever variable we please in case of &lsquo;Rails form helpers&rsquo;, because then we just save them in our session params and not using these model-backed relations</p>

<p>Use whenever we can!</p>

<p>To use this model-backed form, we need to appropriately set our &lsquo;create&rsquo; action in posts_controller.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:post</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#this way we access params specific for our post</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Strong parameters can be a cause of a lot of silent bugs (because they are security-related, there are usually no specific error messages)</p>

<p>!note: we don&rsquo;t want to use .create, because first we need to fulfill validation requirements - strong parameters (check below, then continue here) - so we need to change this like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_params</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:notice</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Your post was created!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="n">posts_path</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">&#39;new&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>!!!!! This above is very important pattern that needs to be memorized !!!!!</p>

<p>  if we create (.save method) our post, we want to redirect</p>

<p>  else (in case we hit a validation error, etc.), we want to render our template where we tried to create from again (which would now show our errors, letting the user know what needs to be done to create)</p>

<h3>Strong Parameters</h3>

<p>back in Rails 3.x this was solved through &lsquo;attr_accessible&rsquo;, which we set in our models
example:</p>

<p>  attr_accessible :title, :url, :description</p>

<p>this above essentially whitelisted the mentioned variables for mass assignment</p>

<p>  Cons of this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>people overdid that and whitelisted everything, whenever hit an error (thus, losing security)</p></li>
<li><p>this needed to be set in the &lsquo;Model&rsquo; layer, and the concern is actually in the actions (&lsquo;Controller&rsquo;)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Rails 4 solves this by using strong parameters instead of attr_accessible</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we can set this in the Controller</p></li>
<li><p>we can set this based on an user</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We set it as a private method:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>this require(:post) relates to our nested structured hash (we need a :post top-level key in our params, and then we set which lower-level (post) keys we want to permit to mass assignment)</p></li>
<li><p>.permit! - permits everything
thus we can use it like this:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Strong parameters can be a cause of a lot of silent bugs (because they are security-related, there are usually no specific error messages)</p>

<h3>Validations</h3>

<p>Always added to the &lsquo;Model&rsquo; layer</p>

<p>We use them like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>post.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>this above means we need to have a title when creating a Post object</p>

<p>if we try to create the Post without the title, we get a rollback (we get returned &lsquo;false&rsquo;; why? because we use if statement in our pattern in the Controller)</p>

<p>note: we can create our post &lsquo;in memory&rsquo;, the error will only appear when we try to hit a database with a query (try to save it)</p>

<p>to check what the error is, we can use .errors method (e.g. post.errors) in the console</p>

<p>when we hit that, we get a @messages hash with errors</p>

<p>then we can use a pre-set syntax post.error.full_messages, to return all the error communicates in an array (e.g. [&ldquo;Title can&rsquo;t be blank&rdquo;, &ldquo;Url can&rsquo;t be blank&rdquo;])</p>

<p>This above is a weird way to save validation errors, but this is Rails convention (to set these types of errors on an object itself)</p>

<p>Looking back at our model-backed form:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can see that if there&rsquo;s an error, we render the view with the form again. We do it, so the user (client) will be able to fix their mistakes (we also need to add specific error communicates to the view - need to display the errors):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>new.html.erb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>we can style these above appropriately ofc</p>

<p>this is another pro to using model-backed forms, because we get those nice errors</p>

<p>!Careful: if we hit an error, in our view (HTML in browser), our errors &lsquo;error fields&rsquo; automatically gets wrapped in an additional div (class=&ldquo;field_with_errors&rdquo;) - this is somethign Rails adds for us out of the box, then it&rsquo;s up to us to only give it a whatever style we want (CSS) (we can highlight the field, etc.)</p>

<h3>Re-using our previously created form for edit and update action</h3>

<p>looking at HTML, this issues a POST request to /posts/id, but we have no route for this - instead it goes to the &lsquo;update&rsquo; action</p>

<p>if we look closer inspecting HTML, there are a few hidden things wrapped in a div, one of them looking like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;_method&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;hidden&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;patch&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>this is where our HTML verb (method) is actually re-assigned to PATCH (Rails uses session params for this, because some browsers only supports GET and POST methods &lt;&mdash; another Rails convention)</p>

<p>!!!!! - form_for is smart enough to recognize if our instance variable (@post in the example) refers to an existing object or creating a new one and will set the correct verb/method (in the hidden element) accordingly &mdash;- thus we can extract our form to a partial and use it for different actions (create, edit, etc.) !!!!!</p>

<p>Our form partial that we could create here would effectively be used by 4 actions (new, create, edit, update) - thus we need to be very careful here.</p>

<p>since our form uses @post instance variable, each action needs to have it defined
make sure to test all the paths that we use/redirect to (especially error cases)</p>

<h3>before_action (in Rails 3.x - before_filters)</h3>

<p>If we notice that in many of our actions we use some code many times, we can extract this to before_actions (which works like before filter in Sinatra):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>posts_controller.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&lsquo;:set_post&rsquo; sets our action to be executed before each action</p>

<p>&lsquo;only:&rsquo; filters this to certain actions we want</p>

<p>since we can set some repeating actions to that kind of before filter, we can end up having some empty methods (Rails conventions again!)</p>

<p>before_action is usually used for two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>to set up instance variable for action</p></li>
<li><p>redirect based on some condition</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Non-stadard flow</h3>

<p>The path we want here is: /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
      - @post needs to be an existing object (we&rsquo;re on show post page, so that&rsquo;s okat)
      - @comment needs to be a new object</p>

<h2>Sum Up</h2>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Quite some notes, as I look at it right now. I know that it&rsquo;s not too pretty (and really chaotic!), I&rsquo;m making notes in my text editor (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime 3</a>) and formatting it would take a lot of my precious time ;) But it&rsquo;s the content that matters, right? The least I could do was to extract and format the code, which I did with a help of a cool Wordpress plugin I just found yesterday, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/codecolorer/">CodeColorer</a>.</p>

<p>The video lasted for about 2.5 hours (split into two parts) and is just one in a series that there are in each Tealeaf course.</p>
