<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">Last time</a> I reported I&rsquo;ll be taking a few days off Tealeaf to practice my skills by building something on my own. While I thought I&rsquo;d be able to accomplish more, I have to say that after six days of hard work (I think I put about 30-35 hours into this) I was able to build a relatively simple, yet still useful ToDo list app. Yeah, I know - everyone is writing todo lists, nothing new under the sun, everybody could do it, etc. Well you know what? Maybe so, but this is the first real, working app that I built totally from scratch. And I&rsquo;m f*cking happy about it :)</p>

<h2>ToDo!</h2>

<p>So what exactly did I put into the app? Well, my goal was to practice the basics, so there&rsquo;s no incredible features, shining effects, stunning graphics, and all that. The idea was, that the user should be able to create his/her own account, where he/she could add tasks to do and mark them &lsquo;accomplished&rsquo; after they are done. Simple as that. Of course, this was not enough when I wrote these basic features, so I figured I could add something more.</p>

<p>I added categories for tasks and the ability for user to create his own categories if he&rsquo;d like. I also added priorities, so tasks could be sorted by their importance. Finally, I figured a way of how to use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html">Ruby Date</a> so tasks can be shown for each day (I also added deadlines for tasks). In the very end I took advantage of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to made it look a little better (I tried with <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> first, but it&rsquo;s not as intuitive as I heard it is).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still nothing great, obviously. But the thing is, it served my purpose very well. I got another confidence boost about how much I&rsquo;ve learned through these couple of months I&rsquo;ve worked with <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> curriculum. And I am convinced I could implement more features into this app, it would be just a matter of how long would it take. With basic Ruby and Rails knowledge, plus using Google, one could really accomplish a lot. I had more ideas for this app, but figured I&rsquo;d better get back to learning before building something more complicated next time.</p>

<h2>Play with It!</h2>

<p>If you wonder how does the app look, you can see a little preview on the screenshot attached to this post. And you can check it out yourself, if you like! I deployed it to <a href="http://herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> production environment, where you can see the working version. Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://intense-reaches-6598.herokuapp.com/">My ToDo! App on Heroku</a></strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to see how the code looks, no problem either. Just take a look at the repo on my Github:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch/todo-app">My ToDo! App Code on Github</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about it, shoot me a comment.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Ahead</h2>

<p>After those few days break for writing the app, I registered for the third Tealeaf course, which focuses on TDD for the large part. I&rsquo;m already past pre-course and am about to wrap the first week in one or two days. So far, it&rsquo;s been great! The teaching style changed along with the main lecturer. There&rsquo;s no holding hands anymore, people who take this course are assumed to know basic Rails and know how to do certain tasks. Explaining new things is also reduced, so that we can figure out most of it ourselves. And I have to say I love this attitude! Of course if I get stuck, there are always TAs available to help on the forums. One thing I&rsquo;m disappointed with, is how empty the forums appear&hellip; People don&rsquo;t seem to be willing to talk much there, compared to previous courses. Maybe this will change over time though.</p>

<p>About the blog, <a href="http://www.webdeveloperfromscratch.com/blog/tealeaf-progress-check-no-3-course-2-done/">last time</a> I wrote about some plans I had for it. I was thinking about writing a blogging app from scratch but after putting some more thought to it, this is probably not the best idea, there are many problems with this I could think off the top of my head even now. Plus, all the time I wanted to give to practice was gone working on the ToDo! app. Still, I don&rsquo;t fully like how this site looks rigth now. I&rsquo;ll likely switch to some other theme, maybe leave <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for good. I also would like to add some pages, like &lsquo;about me&rsquo;, resources I like and recommend and stuff like that. Oh yeah, and I want to stop being lazy here and update more often :P I really want to write this series about basic Rails and I do need to start working on this, so here&rsquo;s my promise to myself: I&rsquo;ll be writing at least one post a week here on WebDevFromScratch (let&rsquo;s say for two months, as a beginning). Let&rsquo;s end this post with that.</p>

<p>Fruitful learning!</p>
