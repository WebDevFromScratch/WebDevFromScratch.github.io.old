<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there!</p>

<p>This is the first post on this soon-to-be-very-cool-and-popular (lol, probably not!) website, so I am kind of excited about this. The site is supposed to be a way of keeping track of my progress in the web development world. Hopefully, it sticks with me for good and a few years from now I&rsquo;ll look at this post and think: &ldquo;Thank god I founded this site!&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s cut the crap and start properly. My name is Piotr, currently 28 year-old Polish guy. I have done various different stuff in my life so far, some exiting, others not too much. The important thing here is that until a few months ago I had totally zero knowledge about web development. I was never too bad with computers, but before I haven&rsquo;t really put my &ldquo;talents&rdquo; to good use. This changed though and I&rsquo;ve been really loving it since I started!</p>

<h2>A Little Bit of Background</h2>

<p>So, why web development? Well, as I said, I&rsquo;ve been doing other things before (another story, not going to bore you with this today) and while they have been interesting too, I realized at some point that I haven&rsquo;t really created anything in my life. Never have I built anything real, that made impact on the world and maybe helped someone in a way by doing so. I was just dealing with numbers, one way or another. And I had enough. It was time to finally make something that exists. Then there was only a question &ldquo;How?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I searched for something that would fit me well and I could possibly be good at. I had just this vague concept of &ldquo;creating&rdquo; as a start. Quickly I realized that things like building something physical in a real world, like a house for example, would not be all that easy. So naturally I wandered in the &ldquo;digital&rdquo; way. And that&rsquo;s pretty much in short how I got to this point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning for this past few months. And I&rsquo;ve been learning hard. Yet I know I barely scratched the surface so far. I know HTML/CSS, some JavaScript (and jQuery) and a little bit of Python. Nothing too serious yet, but even with that limited knowledge I feel like I have powers to really make something of it. And that feels great!</p>

<h2>What Can You Expect Here</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to document my way from here on on this very website. Hopefully, if you decide to follow, you might learn something along. Since I am just a beginner, I will likely be writing in a language that everyone who has not much in common with web development could understand.</p>

<p>Okay, I think this is more than enough for a short introduction. Next posts to follow soon. To the long and productive journey!</p>
